<h1>Wanting simpler ways to make websites</h1>

<p>In this show we talk, learn and build websites. We share our atempts to make them easier to maintain.</p>

<strong>The focus is on:</strong>

<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS (with a smidge of JS if not too scary).</li>
<li>Reducing dependencies.</li>
<li>Not trying to be cleverer than we are.</li>
<li>Standards, accessibility and everything that makes the web better for all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your hosts</h2>

<p>We grew up only a few miles apart in "Middle England". We met when 5,000 mile apart because of the web. It's great, but not always the easiest way to make a living.</p>
