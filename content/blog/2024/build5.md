##  Show Notes


### Is Bento grid designs a fad that will look jaded in a few years?

**Pros**

- We could see it as an approach to layout that's not tied to one aesthetic.
- We can be more adventurous in mixing up styles
- We can add and remove sections without throwing out the balance on the page. 

It seems a reasonable solution for those sites where the homepage has selection of changing offers rather than a story to tell.

**Cons**

- Potential for information overload with no clear hierarchy
- Potential for Accessibility and SEO issues.
- Could get boring.

These can be overcome and putting everything on display can be seen as more transparent (than a guided story) in some eastern cultures.
