**Nathan's Introduction:**

This our second and final video on redesigning a vets site. We thought we needed  three videos, but we are going to see if we can pack it all into two.


In video one  we randomly picked a site for an imaginary redesign and invented some clients' aims, possible branding and structure and came up with a basic mock up in Figma.

David has coded it up  and although there’s room for refinement we’ll assume this is an agile project and this will be done on an ongoing basis. Perhaps informed by real user stats or feedback. 

What we’ll cover here is the approach to the site’s CSS and what we should test before the first  version goes live.

You can download the site via github (see link below) and follow along if you like.  The images on github have been replaced with stock images.
