## Show Notes

## 0. The client contacts us
**Our checks on [Greens Kitchen](https://greenskitchen.uk/).**
- A one page site (apart from cookie and privacy pages). 
- Seems to be new to this domain in 2022.
- WordPress site with the Genesis Theme, WPBakery Page Builder, Smart Slider and Gravity forms.
- Built by a new branding agency (print, marketing and websites). They repupose the same template. 
- A typical page builder site. Not the best usability, speed, accessibility and SEO. Hard black on white is hard to read.

## 1. Client aims

Maybe wants a wider reach and so wants to better highlight things mentioned in the website’s text:

- Show they do group bookings and corporate meetings.
- Show how their menu is dynamic and changing.
- Show they are foodies. Chefs in action? There is no sign of the kitchen.
- Add email or contact form.
- Show the staff (who reviewers seem to like).
- Reach more of the (wealthier) parts of North London.

The copy reads like AI. First line "Greens Kitchen offers the perfect blend of casual dining in a relaxed environment."  Titles don’t match the text and the "something new" section is odd.

## 2. Audience and User Journey

- SEO for a wider London audience? Only the reviews on Google Local Business makes them top there.
- Foodies? People with time and plenty of disposable income (Bruch is popular).
- On a high street so most will know the cafe, but not the food so much.
- Special events.
- Takeaways (tired London commuters coming home!) 

## 3. Branding 

- Maybe enhance the classy logo branding. More classy menu look.
- Use the gold and angle brackets more in the design.
- Logo font: closest match Arimo (Google) and Haggard Nova (paid). Could use DM Serif Display (Google).

## 4. Structure, nav and key content.

- Lose the side nav on mobile.
- About page:  "foodies philosophy".  Shows staff and skills (images of serving staff and chefs preparing).
- Contact page: They are expected and come up in search. It is in easy reach being just off the North Circ. Add parking info?
- Page/s for menus so we can organise the image examples.
- Maybe a page for events?
- SEO: maybe some recipe pages (ideally mentioning other part of Nth London). Posts on commuting and takeaways. Cakes: special occasions (forgot the partner or child's birthday?).

## 5. Hero copy and home sections

- Presently no H1. Need a stronger value proposition than 'Welcome to Greens Kitchen".
- Not mentioned is that it's good for watching the world go past (outdoor seating).
- Google reviews are good so they should link to them.
- Area for events/specials/discounts.
- Homepage as a hub to the above pages.
