## Show notes

For our first redesign we've randomly picked  www.swanzdale.co.uk as it was the first to appear in Google for vets in Scarborough. Perhaps typical of the work a local freelancer might get and could manage without a 3rd party platform.  They know nothing of this.


### 0. Client Enquiry

Ask for an in-person meeting so that we can have some time to think about whatâ€™s needed, as well as some basic SEO work.

### 1. Client aims

Find out what the purpose of the website is?

- Is the point to grow the business?
- Do they need SEO work?
- Are there locales that they are not covering, which they want to?
- Do they want to put some of the admin work (reception staff) over to the website - booking system.
- Do you want to look after the website yourself? Is this just a simple design refresh?
- Are there any mandatory things that people are required to do if they have a pet? Chipping pets etc.

### 2. Audience
People who live in the local area who have access to transport and have a pet.

### 3. Branding

Logo font is https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/trajan-pro-3
Similar Google fonts Cinzel and EB Garamond (but "Times New Roman", Times, serif is close).

### 4. Structure , nav  & key content

Confusing nav!

### 5. Hero copy & homepage sections

Needs a "Value proposition".
