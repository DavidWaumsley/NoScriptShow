We are revisiting a 5 year old debate summed up in Chris Coyier's 2019 CSS Tricks article called [the Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) and looking at what has changed.

  

What's behind the "Great Divide"?
---------------------------------

**A worry:**

*   Over "gatekeeping" and gender bias. If you have to be a programmer [accessible routes to web development narrow.](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/01/30/html-css-and-our-vanishing-industry-entry-points/)
*   That web standards will fall?
*   That code complexity is a cost to the environment and users.

Why does the divide exist?
--------------------------

*   HTML and CSS not meeting the (perceived) component based design needs of the time.
*   CSS not seen as easy to scope for large scale team project work.
*   Browsers not being trusted. Better to use JS to tell them what to do.
*   Marketing (although Meta and Google seem to have lost interest in their React and Angular offerings).
*   The amazing real time user interaction JavaScript brought.

CSS frustrates many. Mostly through not learning it, understanding its declarative nature and impatience. **Rachel Andrew wrote:**

> "CSS is simultaneously too easy to bother with, yet so hard it needs to be wrapped up in a ball of JavaScript in case it scares the horses".

Is it getting smaller?
----------------------

**Technology:**

*   CSS is being rapidly refactored - removing common dependencies on JS (including [interactive ones](https://astro-zerojs-transitions.vercel.app/)).
*   Browsers working together to speed up progress.
*   Web components offering a standards based interoperable alternative to 3rd party JS components.
*   JS fatigue. Maintaining a complex set of dependencies.
*   The Cascade is back with `@layer. @scope and :where()` A move to doing more with less code.
*   WebAssembly (WASM) - a new web standard with more power than JS.

**User demands:**

*   For web content on their terms. Increasingly removing our visual designs and expecting content on any type of device.
*   Frustration with CSS often came from mimicking print.
*   The need to deliver fast, green, valid and accessible HTML content.

The WordPress divide
--------------------

*   For those who use a WYSIWYG builder.
*   More recently, those who develop themes as WordPress moves from PHP themes to JS block themes.
