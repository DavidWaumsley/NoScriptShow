 **Show Notes:**

## What’s an accordion?
  - A collection of (hide and show) disclosure widgets.
  - A collection "headings" with icons which when triggered reveal a panel of previously hidden content.

<strong>Note:</strong> some articles point to other UX patterns. Here we are not considering overlays or anchor links to page content as accordions.

## Types of accordions

- Exclusive. This is when only one panel can be open at a time. 
- Non exclusive where the user can open how many they like.
- Exclusive or non-exclusive with an open/close all toggle.

## Code needed for accordions
 
 Until recently accordions always needed JS and ARIA tags (Accessible Rich Internet Applications). 

 - From Jan  2020 we got the details and summary elements that allowed us make non exclusive accordions with only HTML.
 - From Sept 2024 we could add matching name attributes to the details elements to allow us to create exclusive accordions.
 -  If we want a open/close all toggle we still needs Javascript.
 - [Interpolate-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/interpolate-size) allows us to animate the opening of an accordion panel. It is still experimental and limited to chromium browsers, but is a progressive enhancement.

 ## When we might use them (UX)

 A condensed version of [recent articles ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-on-desktop/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.

 **Benefits**

 - Improving Scannability (less clutter).
 - Reduces scrolling (quicker access to specific content).
 - Can make some content easier on mobile. (large articles or long forms).

 **Downsides** (depending on use and implementation)

 - Increased Interaction Cost.
 - Fragmented Access to Information (can’t compare panel content easily).
 - Difficulty with printing, accessibility, SEO and in-page search

 ## Accessibility  considerations

 Details and summary make things easier as the browser takes care of the interaction, state and role side of things, but to be accessible we can not just add a bunch.

 - We need ARIA to tell the screen readers that these are grouped.
 - Decide if they need to be included in the page's table of contents. 
 - Decide if the accordion headings should be announced as regular headings.

 
 ## Design considerations

 Presently, we have more design control with JS, but more responsibilities. 
 
 We should have a fallback for when JS does not load. Andy Bell lists 15 situations [where this can happen](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available/).

 Here are the design issues with using details and summary.

 - Animation is presently experimental or limited.
 - The browsers marker icon has a limited styling option. We can remove it with content: ""; but Safari presently ignores that. 

Detail and summary open up lots of possibilities. Bramus Van Damme has been doing some [cool experiments](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/styling-details), but following Google accessible carousels that were less than accessible I think these may not yet be production ready.

 ## SEO considerations

Those using accordions dependent on JS might want to research beyond what Google says about being able to find hidden content, but as far as we know there are no issues with using details and summary.

The bonus with details and summary is that in-page search works and panels will open to show the highlighted text. (presently true for Chromium browsers but as part of interop it should be true for other before 2026).

Accordions are often used for FAQ pages. There's [schema](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage) for this, but probably only useful for bonafide health and government sites these days.

## Conclusion

As the no script show focussed doing the most with HTML  we would probably look to other patterns if JS was needed.  For example if there was a page with lots of content sections. We'd probably follow what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion) does by using anchor tags or [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/partial-keyframes/).
