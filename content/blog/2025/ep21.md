## What is website navigation?
  - A list to help users find associated pages and documents?
  - A table of content?
  - An ever-present menu bar?
 


 Terminology is difficult.  What some call navigation and links, others call menus and buttons. A menu to a developer is a [specific role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role). To a UX expert it may define a [pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-elements-glossary/#Menu-Bar).

  

## Types of navigation

- Main link navigation (or menu bar). 
- Navigation activated by a "hamburger" icon.
- Breadcrumbs.
- "Dropdowns" on hover.
- "Dropdowns" on click.
- "Dropdowns" on click and hover.
- Links with adjacent icons indicating a dropdown sub-menus.
- Nested or Multi-level "dropdowns".
- Mega-menus.

There further terminology issues here. As [Heydon Pickering](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/) points out 'dropdown" is behaviour we get with the HTML &lt;select&gt; and &lt;options&gt;. Some refer instead to "pulldowns".  The W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative refers to them as [fly-outs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#flyoutnavmousefixed).

## Code needed for website navigation

- HTML gives us a semantic and accessible name with the &lt;nav&gt; element. Add in some a tags to an ordered or unordered list and we are good.
- Add ARIA and we have an accessible way to have more navigation components on a page and tell screen readers their current page.
- Add CSS and we can have beautiful horizontal nav bars where we can also visually indicate the current page.
- Add JS and we can create interactive show and hide (disclosure widgets) and also create many ways to fail.

## Navigation problems

### UX

- Menu bars often look similar, but behave differently.
- We can’t click on things we do not see.
- Easy dropdown solutions make sloppy site architecture easy too.
- We should indicate links that go to pdfs or external sites.
- Dropdown on hover can interrupt a user’s journey to another target.
- Hide and show option should not obscuring important information.
- Disclosure widgets have an interaction cost.

### Design

- Are dropdowns becoming a [tired design pattern](https://www.strongdesign.co/articles/tired-trend-drop-down-navigation-menus).
- Mega-menus improve UX and we have seen some head turning examples such as [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/gb), but is it best way? It depends on JS .
- Perhaps [view transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) combined with [speculative loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading) could move us from imitating desktop apps.
- Our "menu" has a few items to avoid hambuger clicks, but links to a second nav in the footer. The target is styles and animated.

### SEO

- JS may create  search issues or view it as secondary content.
- Hidden content could lead to less pages visited.

### Accessibility

- Straightforward until we try to hide and show.
- Most checker can not pick up on navigation failures most sites have.
- Technically, &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; can give us accessible dropdowns, but how screen reader announce them is not aways suitable and in-page search makes them stay open.
- Using the role of menu for website navigation means we have to add support for spacebar, arrow keys and escape too. Generally best avoided, but there is this [example](https://accessible-mega-menu.netlify.app/).

 
## Conclusion 

Much of this was informed by Manuel Matuzović's [Web Accessibility Cookbook](https://accessibility-cookbook.com/), the Web Accessibility Initiative work and Sara Soueidan’s  [Practical Accessibility course](https://practical-accessibility.today/).  Not suprisingly the conclusion is that it's far easier to make resillent navigation without scripts (where possible).
