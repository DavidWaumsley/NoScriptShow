 **Show Notes:**

 Following our chat with Paul Lacey on [design systems](https://noscript.show/22/) we are looking at the head element on the No Script Show. How it is set up could be the start of out own design system.  Key points:

 - Our site is on [Github](https://github.com/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow). You can reach head code [here](https://github.dev/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow/blob/main/_includes/partials/head.njk).

 - The site is created with Eleventy ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)) and uses nunjuck templates.
 - We're creating small components containing links to code resources.
 - The aim is to have cut and paste snippets and quality checklists.
