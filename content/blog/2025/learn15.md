## Pull Quotes

  Interestingly, Rachel Andrew's CSS Day 2025 presentation called [Multicol and fragmentation](https://youtu.be/NfwDP9shxNQ?t=2445) talks about the idea of the web being more like printed pages going forward. She introduces the idea of "exclusions" (to normal flow). The examples she shows look much like the patterns designers often try to recreate with pull quotes. 

  <div class="popout center-me" >
