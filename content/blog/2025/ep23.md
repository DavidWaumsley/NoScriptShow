**Show Notes:**


## What is the &lt;head&gt;?

- A HTML element for machine-readable metadata for web documents.
- There can only be one &lt;head&gt; and only 8 tags used:

`<title> <link> <style> <meta> <script> <noscript> <base> <template>`
 - Typically it follows the &lt;!doctype html&gt; and is the first thing in the HTML element.
 
 
<small>It’s worth [validating](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2F) particularly with CMS's where others have access to the &lt;head&gt;.</small>

## Essential &lt;head&gt; elements

- A &lt;meta&gt; tag to set the document charset to <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit">UTF-8.</abbr>

- A &lt;meta&gt; tag to set the viewport to an initial scale to 1 (responsive).
- A &lt;title&gt; tag to name the document.

## Common Issues

### Accessibility

For meet [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled.html) we must have &lt;title&gt; tags that describe the topic or purpose of a page.

- Avoid special characters and [certain types of punctuation](https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/)*.<small> Screen reader can read "|"  as pipe or line or as a pause. Dashes are best.</small>
- Keep titles short and consistent across pages.

- Keep the &lt;title&gt; near the top of the &lt;head&gt; for quick loading.

- Not in the &lt;head&gt;, but it's worth mentioning that not setting <html lang=""> is WCAG fail (and is missing on [15% of websites](https://webaim.org/projects/million/))**.


<small>* [Google](https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/023052.html) also say avoid the vertical line symbol too. [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-/) did an experiment and overall dashes seemed to bring in more organic traffic than vertical lines.</small>

<small>**  Overwriting lang="" and styling it within the body in international phrases and words is underused. It’s pointless these days to cram loads of keywords into titles.

### UX - Page load 

As HTML is rendered line by line, [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) has demonstrated how important to performance structure is. He suggests we should:

- Move what we can out of the head (trackers, JS and some CSS).
- Avoid @import and redirect to 3rd parties.
- Put synchronous JS before CSS. Browsers see if JS refers to CSS. 
- Put <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> headers top as they break parallel preloading.

<small> There's more to discuss such as the benefits of preloading/prefetching assets, speculative loading and when we should use inline CSS, but this offers a great framework.  Harry also has a neat [bookmark](https://csswizardry.com/ct/) we can test our heads with.</small>
