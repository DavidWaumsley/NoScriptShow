**Show Notes:**


## What is the &lt;head&gt;?

- A HTML element for machine-readable metadata on web documents.
- There can only be one &lt;head&gt; with only these 8 tags:

`<title> <link> <style> <meta> <script> <noscript> <base> <template>`
 - Typically it follows the &lt;!doctype html&gt; and is the first thing in the HTML element.

 particularly with CMS's where others have access to the &lt;head&gt;.</p>
</div>


## Essential &lt;head&gt; elements

- A &lt;meta&gt; tag to set the document charset to <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit">UTF-8.</abbr>

- A &lt;meta&gt; tag to set the viewport to an initial scale to 1 (responsive).
- A &lt;title&gt; tag to name the document.

## Common Issues

### Accessibility

To meet [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled.html) we must have title tags that describe the topic or purpose of a page.

- Avoid special characters and [certain types](https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/) of punctuation.*<small> Dashes are safe, but screen readers can read "|"  as "pipe" or "line" or as a pause.</small>
- Keep titles short and consistent across pages.

- Keep the &lt;title&gt; near the top of the &lt;head&gt; for quick loading.

- Just outsite the &lt;head&gt; it's worth mentioning that not setting &lt;html lang=&rdquo;&rdquo;&gt; is a [WCAG fail](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html) (and missing on [15% of websites](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)!).**

<div class="side-note">
<p>* <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/023052.html">Google</a> also says to avoid the vertical line symbol too. <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-/">Semrush</a>  did an experiment and overall dashes seemed to bring in more organic traffic than vertical lines.</p>

<p>**  Overwriting lang="" and styling it for international phrases and words is underused. It’s pointless these days to cram loads of keywords into titles.

### UX - Page load 

As HTML is rendered line by line, [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) has demonstrated how important to performance structure is. He suggests we should:

- Move what we can out of the head (trackers, JS and some CSS).
- Avoid @import and redirects to 3rd parties.
- Put synchronous JS before CSS. Browsers see if JS refers to CSS. 
- Put <abbr title="Content Security Policy">CSP</abbr> headers top as they break parallel preloading.

<div class="side-note">

<p> Naturally, there's more to discuss such as the benefits of preloading/prefetching assets, speculative loading and when we should use inline CSS, but this offers a great overview.  Harry also has a neat <a href="https://csswizardry.com/ct/">bookmark</a> we can check our heads with.</p>

</div>

### UX - design

Missing links to Favicons and metadata for Open Graph and Twitter images.

**Favicons:**

- Since [Safari 26](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-26-release-notes) we have support for [SVG favicons](https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg).
- SVG icons can respond to light and dark preferences. 
- We still need an .ico fall back.

**Social media**

- [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2Fabout) is good for checking OG and Twitter images.
-  If a social image has enough white space one image can serve all.
-  We need an image to stop social media showing the first in the DOM. 

<div class="side-note">
<p> The No Script Show's uses YouTube's thumbnail on the episode pages. For all others there is a generic image. Titles and descriptions for social media is added, but is not needed as it is the same the site's meta.
</p>
</div>

### Technical SEO 

Some things we might want to include in our &lt;head&gt;:


- &lt;meta name=&quot;[robots](https://noscript.show/robots.txt)&quot;&gt; for search engine crawl and indexing.
- &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt; to prevent duplicate content issues.
- &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt; for duplicate content.
- &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;x&quot;&gt; for international sites.
- &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot; type=&quot;application/atom+xml&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt; for RSS feeds.

<div class="side-note">
<p>With CMSs and large content sites the &lt;head&gt; can easily become the source of technical issues.</p>
<p>For example, when <a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/">Web Auditor</a> was run on the No Script Show it showed scores of 301 redirects as a few dynamic URLs were set up without a trailing forward slash (/).  Not major, but extra work for the user's browser that could be easily fixed. See the report <a href="/img/SEO-audit.pdf">here</a>. (The errors are false positives).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/">Screaming Frog's SEO Spider</a>  is a partly free (up to 500 URLs) alternative checker. </p>

<p>The No Script Show has not added Schema.org mark-up. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization">Organization schema</a> might be good for some companies. Perhaps a good signal for Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content">E-E-A-T</a>.</p>
