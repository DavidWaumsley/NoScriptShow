## What is the &lt;head&gt;?

- A HTML element containing machine-readable metadata for web documents.
- There can only be one &lt;head&gt; and only 8 tags used:
`<title> <link> <style> <meta> <script> <noscript> <base> <template>`
 - Typically it follows the &lt;!doctype html&gt; and is the first thing in the HTML element.
 
 
Itâ€™s a good idea to run the W3 HTML validator particularly if using a CMS where you lose control of what is put in the head.
