 # Programmatic CSS. Where is this going?

## CSS changes
### CSS as a  programming  language

- It always was in the sense it tells a computer what to do.
- But as a declarative language it does not give the control expected from an imperative language.
- Intrinsic web design seems to demand a programmatic approach.
- CSS programming is more about giving better hints to the browser (which has to protect content for users).

### CSS’s direction
- Unknown as it’s shaped by consensus. 
- The W3C (with global stakeholders) sets standards aimed to empower humanity, but it can’t enforce them.
-The W3C thinks about long term problems. The commercial world thinks about short term solutions (tortoise and the hare?).

Popular design components that relied on JavaScript to display content are becoming achievable with HTML and CSS.  Examples:  [carousel configurator](https://chrome.dev/carousel-configurator/), [accordions](https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/bGPjBQe/f5761a4ef1339f38668ca7098d0bda26)  and [popups](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/jOeKzpb).

## What does this mean?

If CSS is giving us a programmable flexibility model for web styling this will have an impact on.

### Handcoders

As [Kevin Powell learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_3pRxdv-cI) many CSS fans get upset then CSS becomes hard to read. The dynamic CSS breaks with the old view of it as  a simple presentational code.

### Page Builders

WYSIWYG and CSS in a UI does not really work anymore.


## Coping with more complex CSS

Perhaps we can avoid overwhelm by starting with the basics.

- UX design begins with content and uses design rules (color, proximity spacing) to make that content more manageable for users. This can be applied intrinsically in the browser.

- If we start with semantic HTML most of our accessibility and performance problems are prevented. The message becomes the priority.

- We only need to know the fundamentals of CSS (The cascade, display modes, alignment and sizing) to manually create a decent looking website.

- Generators and recipes from W3C experts can build on that to give us  more flexible layouts and complex components.
