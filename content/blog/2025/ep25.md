**Show Notes:**

## Expectations and clients

In the era of heavily marketed no-code products, it is not unreasonable for many website clients to think web interactivity is easy.

**They may think:**

- If they build it, they will come (the form will itself generate business).
- Complex forms are plug and play and easy to manage.

**Most are less likely to think about**

- UX and accessibility.
- the responsivity needed for today's devices.
- The impact on page load and in turn SEO.
- The potential cost of support and maintenance.

<div class="side-note">
<p>As freelancers, it's tempting to buy an off-the-shelf product to match a client's request. But, if we don't probe enough, we can find ourselves responsible for things we can't control for clients who cannot manage them and that were not actually needed.</p>
</div>

## Do all websites need a form?

The only form many personal and small business sites have is a contact form. There’s lots of debate around whether these are needed these days.

**For**
- Avoids the spam of a public email.
- Lets you collect structured, required information.
- Can route messages to multiple or specific recipients automatically.
- Makes it easier to automate leads into CRMs/databases.
- Standardizes subject lines, making inquiries easier to manage.
- Keeps users on the site rather than opening an email client.
- Can log and analyze submissions for tracking and insights.

**Against**

- Forms can still attract spam without proper CAPTCHA or filtering.
- Users may find forms restrictive compared to writing a direct email.
- Accessibility may suffer if the form is not properly coded.
- Misconfigured forms may fail to deliver messages.
- Requires technical setup and ongoing maintenance.
- Risk of poor design creating confusing or frustrating user experiences.
- Server or plugin vulnerabilities could open security risks.
- Meeting GDPR requirements is more complex with forms.
- If forms are too long or intrusive, visitors may abandon them.

**Additional points**
- Many [UX experts](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contact-us-pages/) say an email address is a key trust factor.
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)'s search of studies concluded contact forms convert 3-5%.
- Clickable Emails & Phone Numbers convert up to 38%.
- Website chat converts at 33-50%.
- WhatsApp message links can achieve click-through rates of 45–60%.
- A phone number field can lead to a drop in submissions.
- No research over disabled users preferring email or forms.

<div class="side-note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have not included links as the statistics are amalgamated or those generated by Perplexity AI.</p>
<p>There is certain to be bias, a difference in methods, and well, it's AI!.</p>
<p> If accessible, short, and the options do not overload the user, a contact form seems a good idea.</p>
</div>

## What are our form options?

Sending form data from a website safely requires us to have a **client** and **server** side.

The **client-side** is the HTML the user interacts with. We can think of it as the bouncer on the front door of a night club. 

They do first checks. We have basic HTML form validation, but presently for accessibility, we typically need ARIA and JavaScript to make them fully accessible.

The **server-side** acts more like the security guarding the VIP section. It checks the data is safe to allow through and stops the riff-raff (spam).

### 1. DIY server and client side

Along with the HTML, CSS, ARIA and JS, we have to manage a self-hosted backend server. Perhaps using:
- Serverless Cloud Functions.
- Static Site Hosting Plus Separate Backend/API.
- Email-to-Form Solutions via Mail Server.
- Open-Source Form Server Software.

We are not going to do that!

### 2. DIY client-side with a 3rd party server-side service

The [No Script Show](/) is doing this for our (yet to be improved) contact form. As we are hosted on Netlify, we could use their service that offers 100 free form submissions per month.

Without adding Cloudflare's Turnstile CAPTCHA Replacement, we were getting about 5 spam emails a day, so without this, we would have used this up. We are presently using Formspark, listed below with similar services:

### 3. 3rd party with a client and server-side service

This, for us, is the most suitable option if we need complex conditional forms for bookings and taking payment. The downside is you lose control over page load, UX and accessibility.

Missing is the popular Google Forms which appears to value accessibiliy and can be extended via addons. 

We will talk more about these in a future episode. Presently favoured is [Tally](https://tally.so/) because of the philosophy behind it. They are based in the EU and are proud to be a bootstrap company with a small team.

Also they do not by default load huge ammount of JS. [Formapp](https://forms.app/), was also not included here because it loaded 1.5MB of javaScript over 49 files with a basic form. It has a focus on AI.

Paperform is added because David has uses it due to getting a low cost life-time deal many years back. It is slow loading with over 0.5MB of javaScript and presently is not yet accessible.


<div class="side-note">
<p>Luckily, we can lazy load iframes so we can prevent heavy forms failing us on Core Web Vitals by putting the form lower in the page or containing it within a details element. </p>
