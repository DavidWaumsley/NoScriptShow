 # Indie Web: a people focussed alternative to the "corporate web"

## What is it?

 - [Indieweb.org.](https://indieweb.org/)
 - [Indieweb on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb)
 - [Heydon Pickering's hilarious explaination.](https://briefs.video/videos/why-the-indieweb/)

 A movement focussed on the web as an egalitarian tool for all. From search to social media to AI, communication on the web is in the hands of a few who get to set the algorithms. The Indie Web represents an alternative to that.

 ## Is it a growing movement?

Perhaps this can not be judged by the numbers of those officially involved, but is seen in various reactions:

- Shifts to Bluesky (AT Protocol) and Mastodon (ActivityPub).
- Renewed interest in the creative personal website. ie. [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [Own Your Web](https://newsletter.ownyourweb.site/) and [HTML for people](https://www.htmlforpeople.com/).
- State intervention: the EU with data protection and accessibility and the US with monopoly concerns.
- Other manifestos such as [The Humane Web Manifesto](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/)

Growing awarness that Google wants us to stay on their domain more and that social platforms change and die.

## What can we do?

<summary> Heydon Pickering's conclusion:</summary>


1. As a content creator, you can reclaim your content from big corporate silos and self-host it. This way your content is your content and you don’t lose anything when Mega Surveillance Media Co decides to kick you off their platform or goes bust. You get to do simple things like edit your content after it’s published and you won’t inadvertently lure people into the clutches of nazi propagandists sharing the same contaminated space.
2. Just because you publish independently, doesn't mean you have to be isolated. You can syndicate your content with technologies like RSS, and invite engagement by implementing a backfeed using standards like [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).
3. As a consumer of content, do not engage with awful people saying awful things. Engaging with them, even to condemn them, only legitimates them and normalizes their bullshit.
4. And finally: the man who entered the Capitol building and had a fatal heart attack did not do so by accidentally electrocuting his own dick with a taser. He just got himself overexcited from all the anger he was being told he should be feeling. Don’t believe everything you read.
