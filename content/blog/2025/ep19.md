 **Show Notes:**

## What David thinks he got wrong

- Not fully comprehending the nature of the web.
- Forgetting the fundamentals (poor semantics).
- Ignoring the rule of least  power (too many dependencies).
- Enforcing systems on clients rather than around them (not being agile).
- Selling websites as various "products" (beyond my ability).
- Not taking payment upfront (early on).
- Not having an escape route (ability to pass clients on).

## What he thinks he got  right, but did badly
- Setting up a recurring income (but not protected).
- Starting with face to face contact (but over complicating).
- Encouraging all into the build process (but creating ways to mess it up).

## What he thinks he actually got right

- Not excluding low budget work or family and friends*.
- Not specialising (frontend skills are general).
- Critically assessing to keep costs down (hosting mostly).

<p><strong>*  I reject these statements:</strong></p>

<ul >
<li>"Clients are not interested in the tools you use".</li>
<li>"Clients are only interested in the value you bring".</li>
<li>"We are the expert - not them".</li>
<li>"Clients without X budget are not serious".</li>
</ul>
<p>Most come from "business" courses aimed at page builders users.
</p>
<p> Similar to online "trader" courses and apps with motivational speakers selling dreams with secret formulas.
</p>
</div>




## What he is trying to solve now

- Better messaging (content first over "pretty pictures" of websites).
- Faster building with snippets. (need more jobs and recurring income).
