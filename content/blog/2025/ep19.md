 # Becoming a better freelance web designer

 Show Notes:

## What David thinks he got wrong

- Not fully comprehending the nature of the web.
- Forgetting the fundamentals (poor semantics).
- Ignoring the rule of least  power (too many dependencies).
- Enforcing systems on clients rather than around them (not being agile).
- Selling websites as various "products" (beyond my ability).
- Not taking payment upfront (early on).
- Not having an escape route (ability to pass clients on).

## What he thinks he got  right, but did badly
- Setting up a recurring income (but not protected).
- Starting with face to face contact (but over complicating).
- Encouraging all into the build process (but creating ways to mess it up).

## What he thinks he actually got right

- Better messaging (content first over "pretty pictures" of websites).
- Faster building with snippets. (need more jobs and recurring income).
