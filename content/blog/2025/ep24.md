**Show Notes:**

## Where we quote

- In testimonials for credibility and social proof.
- In comments for engagement.
- In "pull" quotes for style and highlighting.
- In block and inline quotes for proof in our arguments.

## The difficulty with semantic HTML

We have the blockquote, q and cite elements, but the specifications have changed over time and don’t entirely line up with our design patterns.


Michelle Barker's article <cite><a href="https://css-irl.info/ive-been-doing-blockquotes-wrong/">I’ve Been Doing Blockquotes Wrong</a></cite> highlights how difficult HTML can be at times. 

The official HTML specifications are with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). This tells us:

- Quote elements are for <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">external sources</a> only. Presumably to the page rather than the domain?
- The cite **attribute** is used to specify a URL source. This is invisible to humans and most screen readers.
- The visible cite **element** is for the title of a creative work only and should not be included in the quote element.
- A blockquote is a sectioning **root**. It marks a distinct part of the content, but not part of document's outline as with sectioning **elements** (such as aside, article, nav).

**This means:**
- We should not use quotation elements for (self quoting) pull quotes.
- We should not use cite elements for authors of quotes.
- The citation is orphaned from the quote "section". Not ideal for accessibility.

**It's hard to find consistant advice**

Many [expert sources](https://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/) have encouraged us to use blockquotes in ways that seem technically incorrect including [platforms](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/quote-block/#insert-your-quote) ([code example](https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/coding-blockquotes/)).

-  [Haydon Pickering ](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-blockquote-element/) suggests placing blockquotes and cites within figure and figcaption elements.
- Adrian Roselli recommends against using figure as it is verbose for popular screen readers. However, his [preferred approach](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/07/blockquotes-in-screen-readers.html#Example07) breaks WHATWG rules as he uses cite within the blockquote and uses them for too.

 - The [W3C design system](https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html) uses a footer element to cite an author Unlike Adrian Roselli, they do not use the cite element because of the WHATWG specifications.

Design systems for local governments reveal many other variations. Probably due to changes in the orginal W3C documentation was not carried forward to WHATWG.

 ## Our approach to the HTML

We don’t have the standing to influence specifications like Haydon Pickering, Adrian Roselli or Michelle Barker so we'll stick to  WHATWG rules to be consistent from here on (until told otherwise).

###  Testimonials 

The typical pattern is the external quote followed by the author's name sometimes with a link to their organisation and image of them ([example](https://band.here24.co/)).

For this we will use the W3C design systems approach of not using cite, but putting the author credentials in a footer element within the block quote.

If there is a URL we will add the invisible cite attribute.

 If the testimonial contains a heading the markup would change depending on whether the heading was part of the original quote. If it was, we would add the heading as part of the quote. 

 If not we'd use an [article](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element) as below.

```html
<article>
<h3>Review Title</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The review content...</p>
<footer> — Reviewer Name</footer>
</blockquote>
</article> 
 ```
<div class="side-note">

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> Google's review snippets can not be <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/review-snippet#self-serving">self-serving</a>.
</p>

</div>

 ###  Comments (blog posts)

 According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element)

 <blockquote>
 A blog entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry.
 </blockquote>

 This is what the classic WordPress comment system does.

  ###  Pull quotes

   According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element)

   <blockquote>
   The aside element can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars
   </blockquote>

   Jeremy Keith set off debate in 2016 by asking [Why do pull quotes exist on the web?](https://adactio.com/journal/11102) It's a great question given it is a duplication of content that visually does not look impressive on small devices. It is also not easy to code with many employing JavaScript to achieve it.

  Interestingly, Rachel Andrew's CSS Day 2025 presentation called [Multicol and fragmentation](https://youtu.be/NfwDP9shxNQ?t=2445) talks about the idea of the web being more like printed pages going forward. She introduces the idea of "exclusions" (to normal flow). The examples she shows look much like the patterns designers often try to recreate with pull quotes. 

  <div class="popout center-me" >
