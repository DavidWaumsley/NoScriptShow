**Show Notes:**

## Where we quote

- In testimonials for credibility and  social proof
- In comments for engagement.
- In  pull quotes for highlighting text and styling.
- In block and inline quotes for  supporting our arguments.

## The difficulties with creating semantic HTML

We have the blockquote, q and cite elements, but the specifications have changed over time and don’t fully account for all our design patterns.


Michelle Barker article <cite><a href="https://css-irl.info/ive-been-doing-blockquotes-wrong/">I’ve Been Doing Blockquotes Wrong</a></cite> shows how difficult HTML can be. 

The official HTML spec is at The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). Here are some things we can glean from there:

- Since HTML5, quote elements are for <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">external sources</a> only. Presumably to the page rather than the domain?
- The cite **attribute** is used to specify a URL that points to the source of a quotation. It's invisible to humans and most screen readers.
- The visible cite element should hold the title of a creative work (not an author) and should not be included in the quote element.
- Blockquotes are sectioning **roots**. It marks a distinct part of the content, it doesn't define a new section in the document's outline in the same way sectioning **elements** do (like aside, article, nav).

**This means:**
- We should not use quotation elements for (self quoting) pull quotes.
- Using the cite element after a quote puts it outside of the "section" (Accessibility wise similar to orphaned "read more" links on blog archives).

**But, it's hard to find clear advice**

Many [expert sources](https://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/) have encouraged us to use blockquotes in ways that seem technically incorrect Including [platforms](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/quote-block/#insert-your-quote) ([code example](https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/coding-blockquotes/)).

-  [Haydon Pickering ](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-blockquote-element/) suggests placing blockquote and cite within figure and figcaption elements.
- Adrian Roselli recommended against using figure as it is verbose for popular screen readers. His [preferred approach](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/07/blockquotes-in-screen-readers.html#Example07) breaks with WHATWG as he uses cite within the blockquote and puts authors in there too.
 - Like Adrian Roselli, the [W3C design system](https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html) uses a footer element to cite an author Unlike him, they do not use the cite element because of the WHATWG specification.

 If you look at the design systems for local government you will find many other variations. It is not suprising as the W3C documentation started to evolve differently to WHATWG.

 ## Our approach to the HTML

As we don’t have the standing or experience to influence specifications like Haydon Pickering, Adrian Roselli and Michelle Barker we'll try and stick to the WHATWG specification and be consistent in that from here on (untill told otherwise).

###  Testimonials 

The typical pattern is the external quote followed by the author's name sometimes with a link to their organisation and image of them.

For this we will use the W3C design systems approach of not using cite, but putting the author credentials in a footer element within the block quote.

If appropriate we will add the invisible cite attribute. If the testimonial contained a heading the markup would change depending on whether the heading was part of the original quote. If it was, we would add the heading as part of the quote. 

 If not (in the case of us summarising with a header ) we would use an [article](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element).

```html
<article>
<h3>Review Title</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The review content...</p>
<footer> — Reviewer Name</footer>
</blockquote>
</article> 
 ```

 ###  Comments 

 According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element)

 <blockquote>
 When article elements are nested, the inner article elements represent articles that are in principle related to the contents of the outer article. For instance, a blog entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry.
 </blockquote>

 This is what the classic WordPress comment system does.

  ###  Pull quotes

   According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element)

   <blockquote>
   The aside element can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars
   </blockquote>

   Jeremy Keith set off some debate in 2016 by asking [Why do pull quotes exist on the web?](https://adactio.com/journal/11102). It is a good question given that it is a duplication of content that visually does not look so impressive on mobile. It is also not easy to code with many using Javascript to acheive it.

   On the other hand Rachel Andrew's CSS Day 2025 presentation called [Multicol and fragmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfwDP9shxNQ&t=2493s). In that she talks about the idea of the web being more page like and the idea of "exclusions" (to normal flow). The examples she shows look very much like the  pattern designer are often trying to recreated wit pull quotes.
