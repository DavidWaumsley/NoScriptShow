**Show Notes:**

## Where we quote

- In testimonials for credibility and social proof.
- In comments for engagement.
- In "pull" quotes for highlighting text and styling.
- In block and inline quotes for supporting our arguments.

## The difficulty creating semantic HTML

We have the blockquote, q and cite elements, but the specifications have changed over time and don’t entirely line up with our design patterns.


Michelle Barker's article <cite><a href="https://css-irl.info/ive-been-doing-blockquotes-wrong/">I’ve Been Doing Blockquotes Wrong</a></cite> highlights how difficult HTML can be at times. 

The official HTML specifications are with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). Here's what we can glean:

- Since HTML5, quote elements are for <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element">external sources</a> only. Presumably to the page rather than the domain?
- The cite **attribute** is used to specify a URL that points to the source of a quotation. It's invisible to humans and most screen readers.
- The visible cite element should hold the title of a creative work (not an author) and should not be included in the quote element.
- Blockquotes are sectioning **roots**. It marks a distinct part of the content, it doesn't define a new section in the document's outline in the same way sectioning **elements** do (like aside, article, nav).

**This means:**
- We should not use quotation elements for (self quoting) pull quotes.
- Weirdly for accessibiity, the citation is orphaned from the quote "section".

**It's hard to find consistant advice**

Many [expert sources](https://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/) have encouraged us to use blockquotes in ways that seem technically incorrect including [platforms](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/quote-block/#insert-your-quote) ([code example](https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/coding-blockquotes/)).

-  [Haydon Pickering ](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-blockquote-element/) suggests placing blockquotes and cites within figure and figcaption elements.
- Adrian Roselli recommended against using figure as it is verbose for popular screen readers. But, his [preferred approach](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/07/blockquotes-in-screen-readers.html#Example07) breaks with WHATWG as he uses cite within the blockquote and puts authors in there too.

 - Like Adrian Roselli, the [W3C design system](https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html) uses a footer element to cite an author Unlike him, they do not use the cite element because of the WHATWG specification.

Looking at design systems for local governments we find many other variations. Probably becasue changes in the orginal W3C documentation was not carried forward to WHATWG.

 ## Our approach to the HTML

As we don’t have the standing or experience to influence specifications like Haydon Pickering, Adrian Roselli or Michelle Barker we'll try and stick to the WHATWG specification and be consistent in that from here on (until told otherwise).

###  Testimonials 

The typical pattern is the external quote followed by the author's name sometimes with a link to their organisation and image of them ([example](https://band.here24.co/)).

For this we will use the W3C design systems approach of not using cite, but putting the author credentials in a footer element within the block quote.

If appropriate we will add the invisible cite attribute. If the testimonial contains a heading the markup would change depending on whether the heading was part of the original quote. If it was, we would add the heading as part of the quote. 

 If not (in the case of us summarising with a header) we'd use an [article](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element).

```html
<article>
<h3>Review Title</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The review content...</p>
<footer> — Reviewer Name</footer>
</blockquote>
</article> 
 ```

 ###  Comments (blog posts)

 According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element)

 <blockquote>
 When article elements are nested, the inner article elements represent articles that are in principle related to the contents of the outer article. For instance, a blog entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry.
 </blockquote>

 This is what the classic WordPress comment system does.

  ###  Pull quotes

   According to [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element)

   <blockquote>
   The aside element can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars
   </blockquote>

   Jeremy Keith set off  debate in 2016 by asking [Why do pull quotes exist on the web?](https://adactio.com/journal/11102) It's a great question given it is a duplication of content that visually does not look impressive on small devices. It is also not easy to code with many employing JavaScript to achieve it.

  Interestingly, Rachel Andrew's CSS Day 2025 presentation called [Multicol and fragmentation](https://youtu.be/NfwDP9shxNQ?t=2445) talks about the idea of the web being more page like going forward. She introduces the idea of "exclusions" (to normal flow). The examples she shows look very much like the patterns designers are often trying to recreate with pull quotes.
