 # When do web clients need a CMS?

We asked our good friend [Paul Lacey](https://paullacey.digital/) for his thoughts on offering clients a CMS and to our delight he agree to come on the show.

## What is a CMS?

<blockquote>A Content Management System is software that helps users create, manage, store, and publish digital content.
<cite><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/content-management-system">IBM</a> </cite> </blockquote>

**Some...**

 - don't even consider WordPress a CMS.
 - refer to SSG's and page builders as a CMS.
 - use the term to indicate a no code way to manage content.

Here we're foccusing on the last one.


 ##  Why would we offer clients a CMS?

 - They need it?
 - It's an atractive sales feature?
 - They'll might hire us to manage it?

  ##  Why would we not offer clients a CMS?

  - Costly set up, maintenance and support.
  - Cost of training and managing staff changes. 
  - Web content is better handled by web professionals.
  - Fear of dependencies.
  

  ## What's included in a client CMS?

  - Ability to redesign existing pages?
  - Ability to add post posts or create landing pages?
  - Ability to only change text and media without altering the the HTML?
  - Ability to add software and invite contributors.
