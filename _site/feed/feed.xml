&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-head&quot;&gt;What is the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A HTML element for machine-readable metadata on web documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can only be one &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; with only these 8 tags:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt; &amp;lt;base&amp;gt; &amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically it follows the &amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt; and is the first thing in the HTML element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&amp;useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&amp;acceptlanguage=&amp;doc=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2F&quot;&gt;validating&lt;/a&gt; the HTML
 particularly with CMS&#39;s where others have access to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;essential-head-elements&quot;&gt;Essential &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; tag to set the document charset to &lt;abbr title=&quot;Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit&quot;&gt;UTF-8.&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; tag to set the viewport to an initial scale to 1 (responsive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; tag to name the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-issues&quot;&gt;Common Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled.html&quot;&gt;WCAG 2.2&lt;/a&gt; we must have &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; tags that describe the topic or purpose of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid special characters and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/&quot;&gt;certain types&lt;/a&gt; of punctuation.*&lt;small&gt; Dashes are safest. Screen reader can read &amp;quot;|&amp;quot;  as pipe or line or as a pause.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep titles short and consistent across pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; near the top of the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; for quick loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that not setting &amp;lt;html lang=””&amp;gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html&quot;&gt;WCAG fail&lt;/a&gt; (and missing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/million/&quot;&gt;15% of websites&lt;/a&gt;!).**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/023052.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also says to avoid the vertical line symbol too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/blog/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-/&quot;&gt;Semrush&lt;/a&gt;  did an experiment and overall dashes seemed to bring in more organic traffic than vertical lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**  Overwriting lang=&quot;&quot; and styling it for international phrases and words is underused. It’s pointless these days to cram loads of keywords into titles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux-page-load&quot;&gt;UX - Page load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As HTML is rendered line by line, &lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/&quot;&gt;Harry Roberts&lt;/a&gt; has demonstrated how important to performance structure is. He suggests we should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move what we can out of the head (trackers, JS and some CSS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid @import and redirects to 3rd parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put synchronous JS before CSS. Browsers see if JS refers to CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put &lt;abbr title=&quot;Content Security Policy&quot;&gt;CSP&lt;/abbr&gt; headers top as they break parallel preloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naturally, there&#39;s more to discuss such as the benefits of preloading/prefetching assets, speculative loading and when we should use inline CSS, but this offers a great framework.  Harry also has a neat &lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/ct/&quot;&gt;bookmark&lt;/a&gt; we can check our heads with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux-design&quot;&gt;UX - design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing links to Favicons and meta data for Open Graph and Twitter images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favicons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-26-release-notes&quot;&gt;Safari 26&lt;/a&gt; we have support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg&quot;&gt;SVG favicons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG icons let us use &amp;quot;prefers-color-scheme&amp;quot; to have light and dark versions. It is on this site as an experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still need an .ico fall back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metatags.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2Fabout&quot;&gt;metatags.io&lt;/a&gt; is good for checking OG and Twitter images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a social image has enough white space one image can serve all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need an image to stop social media showing the first in the DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The No Script Show&#39;s uses YouTube&#39;s thumbnail on the episode pages. For all others there is a generic image. Titles and descriptions for social media is added, but is not needed as it is the same the site&#39;s meta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-seo&quot;&gt;Technical SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things we might want to include in our &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/robots.txt&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; for search engine crawl and indexing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot;&amp;gt; to prevent duplicate content issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;robots&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;noindex&amp;quot;&amp;gt; for duplicate content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; hreflang=&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;&amp;gt; for international sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/feed.xml&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;application/atom+xml&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; for RSS feeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With CMSs and large content sites the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; can easily become the source of technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/&quot;&gt;Web Auditor&lt;/a&gt; was run on the No Script Show it showed scores of 301 redirects as a few dynamic URLs were set up without a trailing forward slash (/).  Not major, but extra work for the user&#39;s browser that could be easily fixed. See the report &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/img/SEO-audit.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (The errors are false positives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;Screaming Frog&#39;s SEO Spider&lt;/a&gt;  is a partly free (up to 500 URLs) alternative checker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No Script Show has not added Schema.org mark-up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization&quot;&gt;Organization schema&lt;/a&gt; might be good for some companies. Perhaps a good signal for Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content&quot;&gt;E-E-A-T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following our chat with Paul Lacey on &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/22/&quot;&gt;design systems&lt;/a&gt; we are looking at the head element on the No Script Show. How it is set up could be the start of out own design system.  Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our site is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. You can reach head code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.dev/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow/blob/main/_includes/partials/head.njk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is created with Eleventy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;) and uses nunjuck templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re creating small components containing links to code resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to have cut and paste snippets and quality checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. For the last couple of episodes, we&#39;ve been looking at components that make up a website. In doing that, we are building a library that we can refer to, particularly for the next time we build demo websites on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be considered a part of a design system, but apart from knowing this is a hot topic, we&#39;re not sure what a design system is to try and unpack this, we&#39;re delighted to be joined once again by our friend Paul Lacey. He, unlike us, has actually managed to put some form of design system together for his own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apart from my usual, hello to David Wamsley. Hello, David Wamsley. Hello. I&#39;m gonna also, yeah, thank you. I&#39;m also gonna say hello to Paul Lacey. Lovely. Hello. Now that we&#39;ve got the introductions out of the way, Paul, I just a second because our listeners, if they haven&#39;t heard a previous episode, they won&#39;t know who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m gonna put you on the spot. Give us your potted bio quickly, if that&#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:01] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;re correct to first of all say I&#39;ve done some form of a system, so I&#39;m glad you said that. also, I&#39;m not a full, on expert in this. I&#39;m much like yourselves just knowing about it, see and aware that I&#39;m doing some aspects of it, interested how I can improve it myself, and looking to see where things are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know David does a lot more probably academic study of this sort of thing because when we talk, I know he&#39;s read books on it, which I haven&#39;t. And, but yeah, so what I am a web designer developer, probably started around 1999, I think it was. I&#39;ve seen a lot of change from the, using, non breakable spaces for design for instead of, CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I started, there wasn&#39;t really any CSS right at the beginning. There probably was, but we weren&#39;t using it at the beginning. Then CSS comes in and then the.com boom and burst and all that sort of stuff. And then I think we&#39;re still. We&#39;re still recovering from that now, just in terms of how the whole western world seems to think what web design is or should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this whole design system thing is called because it&#39;s lays down some rules that if we all, if everybody got on board and followed it, it would make for much better websites, I think. And, but where we are, I think these days is that certain level of organizations are good at, dealing, implementing these things and running them because everybody&#39;s on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then as you go down and organizations get smaller, you get to a point where, the web designers are on board with these sort of things, but perhaps not everybody else is. So it&#39;s a real challenge to figure out how you can have these systems in your mind and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there are lots of factors that can derail these sort of things. So I&#39;m hoping that we might get to the bottom of some of that today. we might not even get as far of defining what all this stuff is, but we&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, indeed. So as is always the case, David has put together some show notes, which I&#39;ll share on the screen, but you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that didn&#39;t work out so well. There we go. You can find them at no script show and then slash the number 2, 2 22. So no script show slash 22. Shall we should we pop that on the screen, David and crack on and I&#39;ll basic hand the bat on over to you at this point, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s only basic notes so we can try and get some definitions &#39;cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you say, I read some books on this stuff. I, when I read articles and I hear terms like design systems used in different contexts, I don&#39;t know what people are meaning by it. There&#39;s other things like, DI design tokens, I dunno what that means. And there&#39;s different definitions out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought it&#39;d be good to chat because Paul and I have had some conversations before. &#39;cause it&#39;s the holy grail to try and find some way, particularly if you&#39;re just working on your own, to efficiently create your own websites and backing out. WordPress days, we&#39;ve always tried to get some starter website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&#39;s go. I, put a couple of definitions up there, which may be Nathan, you&#39;ll need to read because I&#39;m on a very small screen and I can&#39;t read what I&#39;ve written. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; fine. Yeah. So again, I&#39;m reading off the screen, no script do show forward slash 22, and the, headline for that is, are design systems worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we&#39;re gonna begin by asking the question, what do we mean by design systems? There&#39;s a couple of quotes, which I&#39;ll just read out. The first one says, A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns. And I can, that&#39;s the Norman Nielsen or Nielsen Norman, I can never remember group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then a source. From Figma, the design tool, a design system is a single source of truth that reduces design redundancy and accelerates the development process. So I guess they&#39;re broadly similar in a way. Do you want me to read the other bits about the, who uses a design system, or should we dwell on the, what do we mean first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, I like these definitions. I don&#39;t know about you, Paul, because they&#39;re, pretty vague. So under this definition, what you&#39;ve been doing with the page builder that you&#39;ve used, you&#39;ve created this whole system to be able to put together websites through these kind of row templates, haven&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can do that and there&#39;s nothing there that would say, that&#39;s not a design system, I don&#39;t think. And you could argue even what we&#39;re trying to do at the moment, which is, it&#39;s interesting because our series that we&#39;ve done before, I was model it on the idea of what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, in a way was thinking, okay, what I want to do is to have not necessarily row templates because I&#39;m working much more with grid and, my page layouts might be different, but the fact that I thought I needed something so I could grab this bit here and have a header here to here about, a middle section, some, accordions and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve gone on, you realize for, us, that a component ends up being an examination of what the HTML and CSS options are when you are constructing something. It doesn&#39;t turn out to be something I can easily drag and drop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So does that, when you say that, so obviously rows, we understand what that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That usually represents from the left to the right of the screen and it&#39;s a horizontal block of stuff. But a component is the, bits, if you like, that might sit with inside that. But are you saying then that the component, when you really get to it and you do this work over and over again, you realize that even that sort of definition and clarification doesn&#39;t work because it might be that you want to take out a little bit with within that component itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so really what you are forcing yourself to do is forget how it looks, forget the bit that you could drag and drop onto the canvas for want of a better word. You are saying worry about the actual code that makes that up. That&#39;s the component. The ht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. we started ourselves trying to do the accordion and straight away we realized that where the accordion is used and what we expected to do, so we&#39;d have to have a whole series of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in terms of us getting some sort of design system was really a. But we&#39;re putting together something as part of our series, which ends up being nothing more than a few sort of bullet points about how this will work for accessibility, when this is appropriate to use, and not that is more useful than the drag and drop component itself, So it&#39;s been quite interesting, our own attempt to build a design system, which gets more naughty the. The more you get into it. But anyway, sorry. I, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m gonna keep this going if you don&#39;t mind. &#39;cause I think this is interesting because the word design by definition, I think is the use of the, I, at least in my head, I&#39;m, imagining what I can see more than anything else, as in what is put on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously you&#39;ve got tools like Figma, that&#39;s their bread and butter, isn&#39;t it? Is what is the whole point of that tool is to create things that you can send to people and you can see it. But what you are saying is that for you, that definition, you&#39;ve gotta atomize it a little bit further and go, into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it might be that, okay, there is an accordion, you can see that&#39;s fine. But because of the various different ways you could use an accordion, it might not look the same each time. And design system already we&#39;re we&#39;ve come against some trip wires because I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s what you look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it, and not really, that doesn&#39;t live up to the definition you&#39;ve just described of code. So that&#39;s interesting. I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s quite interesting. If you look at the design systems, well-known design systems that are out there, like there is, the material design system by Google. there is, there&#39;s Nord Health there, there have a big design system, which is perhaps more about the look of things that you might bring in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then when you start to look at, I think interestingly there&#39;s been a move, if you look at the, there&#39;s design systems as well for the UK government, so there&#39;s one that will go with gov UK and is now the same with us as well. And when you look at those, they. There, there will be, there&#39;s elements about their own, but they&#39;re very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their public sites have to be design-wise, quite simplistic. But there, when you look at it, it&#39;s often seems to be a lot more about the rules about how to make this particular thing accessible. it&#39;ll be, and it, gets much more closer to the component of the design system, if you like, is really the raw H two ML, Okay. More often or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Paul, do you wanna do any more on that before we move on to the next section?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:04] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sure. The, definitions, I much prefer the n nng one with a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just &#39;cause it just, It just gels with me a little bit better. I would like, personally in my life, I would remove the word complete and it would be a set of standards. And I, because it has the word intended, I like that. &#39;cause it&#39;s, saying that we&#39;re trying to do this rather than the, other definition from Figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that will definitely ring, will definitely vibe well with UX and ui, designers who use that Figma product. I think, this whole concept is a single source of truth that reduces design, redundancy, accelerates development of process, et cetera. I just, what comes to mind with all this sort of stuff is that the, whole concept of design system can turn a lot of people off immediately because it immediately goes, sounds technical and immediately sounds like, ex exclusionary to people who don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m thinking, when you take any of the companies that we might have mentioned, If anyone who&#39;s not a designer or developer and not thinking about the HML or these, global colors or variables and stuff like that, it&#39;s are we even part of this conversation? So if you take the actual, the end user audience, how can someone in the audience or the audience of a website contribute to a com conversation and feedback on the design system and how well it&#39;s used being used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can HR feedback on that? How can CEOs feedback on that sort of thing? So I quite like the NNG one because it&#39;s more open also, I know we don&#39;t have it up on the screen, but the, looking at the, a couple of those, design systems, David, that you highlighted. I really do the, Gov uk, the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design system. because it, it&#39;s accommodated everybody that needs to understand it. It&#39;s, given the code. It gives you the code snippets and it shows you what you should be doing on that level. But the way it communicates about its design system, patterns or components is in human language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whereas the three of us might talk about, we need a design system for an accordion, what&#39;s the point of the accordion? whereas the UK government website tends to say things like, here is a, design system for when you need to get somebody&#39;s credit card details for them to pay a bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, so it gives you the kind of point of why you would even care about this. And so then the finance department is saying. Oh, this sounds good. So we&#39;ve got a more efficient way to get the money from people who owe the money, or we also have included in that design system a way for them to, present to the user what to do if they have a problem paying this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so everybody&#39;s benefiting that, the different departments are understanding where, what the point is for them. what&#39;s in it for me in the finance department to be, to care about this design system that, Dan from head of Design was going on about in that meeting that I was falling asleep in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I really liked that because, and that this is maybe why, if you&#39;ve struggled to get started yourselves, it might be because. why it might be easier for me is because I don&#39;t have to worry about the HTML too much because I&#39;ve essentially made a decision to not care about it as much, which I know some, if somebody might listen to this and be like, what the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what kind of professional are you? But essentially, I&#39;m living in the world where I need to use WordPress themes and WordPress page builders, and a bunch of those decisions are taken away from me. So I&#39;m straight into the point where I&#39;m thinking about, I&#39;ve got a decision, I&#39;ve got two options at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can go straight into thinking about the elements that I want. So do I want a row, let&#39;s say with, a call to action in it and those sort of things? Or do I, do, I go into purpose led thinking, which is what I&#39;ve been trying to do more recently. Essentially, it&#39;s the same stuff, but the, purpose again, of a pricing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you start with the purpose and it is to present the. options and recommend an option to a user. So how do we present the options of our product and recommend which one is probably right for them? And if we think about it from that angle, then we&#39;ve in, we&#39;ve included into our design system, the point of the element or the pattern or the component, and then we work backwards from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then eventually. You can take that, rationale of why you need this component and you can stop at the point that&#39;s comfortable for me, I stop at the point where I&#39;m dragging these elements in and designing them in Beaver Builder. Whereas if you want, you can go further back and ditch that, aspect and get, and then go, we know the point of it, we know what the users want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know what HML tags we might need as opposed to just looking at some other, I&#39;m not saying you do this, looking at some pricing tables and seeing what elements appear to be there and then coding those up. So you&#39;ve always got, like the government, UK government website has, you&#39;ve always got this design component or this component or pattern can, be measured as failing or SU succeeding because there is a mission for it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I dunno if any of that made sense, but that&#39;s, That&#39;s where the two strict ones, like the Figma one to me is, a, I&#39;m reading it and thinking that this is less inclusive as the one above it from NNG because the NNG one is talking about its managing design at scale. It&#39;s reusing components and patterns, and it&#39;s intending to improve that process rather than be a kind of, elitist sort of set of Figma documents that nobody else understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you don&#39;t know, and if you come in as a designer to our team and you don&#39;t know what this is, gosh, what&#39;s wrong with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I try to just encapsulate what you&#39;ve just said, I think in one sentence? no, It&#39;s no. But in order to just clarify in my head. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So I think what you just said then would be something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;d have a Paul Lacey quote on that page, and it would say something like, A design system is a text description of design of the purpose. Of design elements, visual design elements, which are reusable, scalable components and what have you. So it&#39;s, got that kind of description bit in text as the focus, like the Gov UK one that you were describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah. And because you&#39;ve described its purpose, you&#39;ve made it more accessible to people who don&#39;t have a, a background in graphic design for want of a better word, because you&#39;ve, explained what its point is on the page. Is that about right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:26] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it means that you could have a conversation with the finance department that Informs how you should make this, these components and patterns that fit into your design system. like further down this document is probably some stuff about the ingredients of a design system. Like the finance department doesn&#39;t need to contribute too much about the brand colors. In fact, they don&#39;t need to contribute about that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they probably don&#39;t need to. I forget what it&#39;s called. There&#39;s, the components, the patterns, there&#39;s, the really little things. They&#39;re like the variables. What are those called? tokens. Tokens. So that stuff is to me, for the, brand and the design team to know that, green means go, red means stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amber might mean, think about it, blue means information. they might make those sort of decisions based on the brand and, but the, actual HML elements that, so the HML feels that it&#39;s more of a, it&#39;s more of a human conversation with, the, stakeholders and then the brand element is more of an internal design, creative, side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but yeah, I think Nathan, what you more or less said, is, probably a better definition just, for me because, I&#39;m, I have to have conversations with clients all the time and I have to try and justify why I&#39;ve done something and I can&#39;t just say, because Figma told me to, based on their amazing design system As such, no, no offense to Figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. but to make it c communicable to who? The people I&#39;m trying to convince to not have a slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; David, should we move on? Or If you&#39;ve got things to Yeah, let&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, we can actually, because we can widen it up. I think once we&#39;ve covered some of the points we&#39;ve put down here, so we&#39;ve just quickly, who uses a design system? So I mean there&#39;s, I guess there&#39;s two different types in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the large sites that need consistency as they keep changing their website, regardless of who&#39;s employed at the time. So they need some. Set of rules, if you like, about how this, the styling and the content is added to a particular style to a site. And then we&#39;ve got the, people like us, maybe were solo designers or maybe small groups and that who want quick ways to assemble websites and might use a design system like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s where you might, borrow something that&#39;s already existing out there. nor, or the material design or something from Google as a starting point, or effectively even as a lot of us do, we use a, it&#39;s not exactly a design system, but effectively it gets close to it. Something like Bootstrap becomes a design system tailwind, they become, even though they&#39;re CSS based, they become a sort of design system we can borrow, And then of course, and then the big question about design systems, and that&#39;s why you see a lot of debates about, you don&#39;t need a design system, you&#39;re wasting your time with it. And those people who say you absolutely do need a design system. And I think this is where you hear all these different conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause everybody has a different idea about what that might mean to them. So you if you invest too much, you can invest. As I&#39;ve done before, invested a lot of time trying to copy Paul and what he managed to do with his Beaver builder. I&#39;m so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:01] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m so sorry. We&#39;ll have led to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but I&#39;m just trying to do the same thing when we were both using the same page builder. Yeah. And I was trying to do the same thing as you, and you actually managed to get something that was useful, that worked for the jobs that you needed to do. I was envious of that when I started doing something in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got myself so caught up in. Sort of little elements. And the same thing has exactly happened in this series as well. When you get into components that I talk myself out of ever getting a system that works. but maybe one day I&#39;ll get there and it&#39;d be very thorough and it will work for me, but it&#39;s quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m definitely in that. Gotta invest in the right thing for the job that I&#39;m doing. I think you&#39;ve balanced that, right? And I, that&#39;s why this interests me how, to do it for us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anyway. Sorry, I&#39;m going off a bit there. That&#39;s okay. No, that&#39;s fine. So this is, the section who uses a design system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have we finished on that one? There&#39;s something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting on that. I just would say like the large sites that need consistency, regardless of who&#39;s working on them. This reminds me of my old, company that imploded Dicky Birds. this is why you should listen to me. I such success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it reminds me, &#39;cause, myself and my business partner both had different roles. we were working with totally different clients. my. Business partner Piera was working with a major, car manufacturer. One, the, one of the biggest ones in the world. And that was like our, probably our biggest client technically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was pretty much all he did, apart from a few other bits where he would contribute to some of the work I was doing. And I was working with SMEs and charities. And so we, we would argue actually when we collaborated on my projects, because his mindset was way more, long term than, mine. And I would be asking things of him that were borderline offensive to the way that he was learning to, he&#39;d learned to work, working as kind of part of a team at Nissan because essentially he was, he became integrated in the team and was leading UXs and UIs and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was a lot of separation. In these things, there was a lot of, rules and you couldn&#39;t break the rules because if you did, you would be, someone would hold you to account. And it&#39;s interesting &#39;cause you&#39;ve got those two first ones, large sites that needs con consistency. So we could say large companies or brands and then solo designers who want to assemble websites quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it&#39;s the lifespan of the design system for the large brand is basically infinite. It changes, but there&#39;s always a design system that is being used every single day. Whereas the web designers who are doing a client job, they might have a design system that&#39;s a lot looser than that, and they bring that design system into the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do the job, and then the design system essentially semi-retire. And the designer hopes that if the client goes off with that website that they carry on and try to make use of the systems that were put in place there. In most scenarios, they possibly don&#39;t. And that&#39;s why you have websites that launch and then they just degrade over time and become stale, and they lose the, initial, effectiveness that they might have had on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there&#39;s a lifespan that goes through these design systems that is very short with web designers. They have a drop in design system that doesn&#39;t use all the ingredients, but it helps &#39;em get the job done effectively and quickly then. Is gone. And the website just lives there. But with these big companies, the design system is part of every single decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nothing goes on the website unless it passes the design system. So it is just, we would argue, because I would say things like, I need a design for this by Friday, and it might be Tuesday already. And he would be like, so what do you want? Do you want, are you gonna give the UX to the client first? I was like, no, we just need to give them the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I&#39;d be, and I would be trying to, he&#39;d be saying, we&#39;re skipping the stage. And I&#39;d be saying, we&#39;re not skipping the stage. What we need to do is. Internalize that stage with our experience and just get it done and we need to use our experience to get the UX done. And he would say, no, we need to do the UX and get sign off on that before we&#39;re doing any design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would be saying, we will get fired. So it just is the kind of the friction and just like none of us were wrong in this. I was just, we were just living in different environment and he was right actually. And, but I was looking after the wellbeing of a company surviving in a, world that doesn&#39;t appreciate design systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. Should we move? Yeah, let&#39;s move on. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; The next section, once largely, I&#39;ve taken the main bullet points actually from an article that is, that I&#39;ve linked to, which is the Nielsen Norman Group one. So it&#39;s basically there, 1 0 1 on what is a design system. I did add something extra to this, which is design tokens, which is a term that&#39;s banded about, but what makes up a design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So largely it&#39;s got style guides, design tokens. You could argue that they overlap with each other, component libraries and maybe pattern libraries. That might be one way of breaking these things up. does that sound right to you, Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:45] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Do you know what, I didn&#39;t even know what design tokens was until I saw this a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to, I, understand what it is now. It&#39;s almost the technical layer between the brand guidelines or the style guide. So it could be like a CSS variable that is, saying, let&#39;s say a success variable. And that might be that the style guide informs that to be a green color highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So am I right about that? It&#39;s the,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I think it, it depends. I think the term comes from, I believe Salesforce and their own design system. And there&#39;s a particular, I think a name Gino and I&#39;ve forgotten their name, who&#39;s, really championed that. And she would very much see those as separate to, a CSS variable, where other people might see it as akin to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would see it as, do you know, can I step back and just, talk about why I think. This is interesting or where it gets confusing. &#39;cause I would think 2014 was such a significant year for, revitalizing the idea of getting, so you&#39;ve got this whole bunch of people. You had Brad Frost Atomic Design, which we talked about on this show, didn&#39;t we, Nathan before, which is, a way of thinking about how you build up a website out of Lego blocks, and at the same time you had reacts JavaScript component library appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got that whole way which you love your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:17] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But these two things, without a doubt they influence, the future of things like Gutenberg for, WordPress. It was only in the next year when, Matt Mullen, we was talking about, blocks and the idea that JavaScript was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got that. At the same time, it was about the same year where you&#39;ve also got this. Country thing going with, I think gov uk it was the year that they won the only design award, national design award for a website before for going almost the completely opposite way with their own kind of design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think a lot of, when we talk about it, we have different ideas. So people think it&#39;s made up of, we&#39;re, thinking of react when we talk about components, people think of react even though there&#39;s web components. Yeah. Which predate it. So there are, I think that&#39;s why a lot of our, disagreements on what we think that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, design tokens is a word that I hate using because in a way, I don&#39;t know what I mean by it. It, I think that they would see it as one of Brad Frost&#39;s, the smaller atoms that make up a section of a website. but style guides, and this is where I think we mix things up because I think style guides is something that could stay, couldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a company for all time. When you try to realize those style guides, that&#39;s fine. They can be turned into CSS that you go by. But when it comes to the, there&#39;s a gap in here, I think, when it comes to the rest of the design, because you either take the view that you&#39;re making up with Lego blocks, these components, but then you&#39;re failing to see the designer as a whole If you work that way. and it&#39;s the same when you build pattern libraries. it&#39;s making an assumption that pattern will remain true for all time. Where I think we already know, technically this is very difficult as we see CSS particularly changing at the moment. it. the design system that I was working on, that you are working on is based around the fact that the only layout system we had for the web was Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have grid, it throws that out. Now we have container queries that throws it out soon. We are about to get into more things with, if statements where we might be able to program in all sorts of different types of arrangements for our website. So I do think, if you try to invest in a design system at the very technical level, it&#39;s very difficult at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could waste a lot of time, but style guides maybe are something that can remain in a company as you always use this particular color for your, your links and for your header and your photo or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ll just point out that if you, if you go to no script show slash 22, there&#39;s a couple of links on the what makes up a design system, section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them links out to, the Norman Nielsen Group as an article called Design Systems Versus Style Guides. And the other one, heads off to Figma, docs Token Studio, tokens Studio for Figma. So there&#39;s a couple of links provided by David there if you want to explore further. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we move on to the next bit? How do we get the design system? All right. Okay. Three options off the shelf, adapted from other sources or custom, I&#39;m guessing off the shelf, is what most people are gonna use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, I. I guess so. I dunno, we&#39;ve always tried to build and in effect, what Paul&#39;s done and what I&#39;ve always been trying to do as well, the same time was always a, to some degree off the shelf in the sense that we&#39;re, held to the platform that we, using there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got some restrictions that come with that. I do think it&#39;s interesting though, with things that change. I think with, when you get sonic off the shelf, you are trusting that company. So when you look at, there&#39;s been some huge errors with, material design. they totally broke the web&#39;s accessibility with forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decided that placeholders were a great thing to do and you can remove your titles from your form. making forms terrible for ages. Same with Bootstrap. It decided, bootstrap, I think four or something. It decided that. They were unsightly to underline our links, effectively breaking the site for whole, breaking the web for a whole bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do think, there is an issue when you look for off the shelf. Where can you, particularly as things change, particularly as we become more aware of getting back to the basis of the web, making sure that it is truly inclusive, that it does, look at accessibility. This is something that I think has grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t there so much back in 2014 when I think we had this resurgence of the idea that we could have great design systems. So I think now getting something off the shelf would be quite tricky unless, unless it was something I would get great ideas from, the UK Gov side or Gov UK side because you know that they, as a, they&#39;ve learned the lesson that they need to make sure that what they put there serves everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so are you a bit more, so there&#39;s three bullet points there. again, this is for people listening to it off the shelf, adapted from other sources. And custom, David is your plan to do a bit of two in the hope of getting to three. So you&#39;re adapting from other sources, but doing it in a custom way. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;ll be interesting to see what we build up if we actually end up with a design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause we&#39;re doing this series where we&#39;re looking at different bits of websites effectively, where, we started with the co word components, but it&#39;s bits and bobs of websites that we&#39;re talking about. next time we&#39;re talking, we&#39;re gonna be talking about the head as a component, something you don&#39;t see even on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I see it as a component because there are certain rules about how you might construct your head in your document. So I would, so I&#39;m going there. Whether that turns into a design system, it is already for me because of the fact that I&#39;m saying. Okay. I&#39;ve got little notes in my, 11th at the moment, but it could be equally in a WordPress version of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little notes in this section where I put my head code and where I put certain things. So there is a sort of design system building up. But yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anything to add there, Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:03] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, so off the shelf is probably, like David said, always a little bit tricky because off the shelf is normally a digital product type thing or something to that effect that is trying to help you get from A to B super quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has to promise certain things that make sense to the person who is trying to cut some corners to get somewhere quickly. So I think that&#39;s when, we&#39;ve all lived in the WordPress world for quite a while and we&#39;re aware of the amount of templates you can buy or get for free, for different page layouts, row layouts, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I, think that the most of the three of us. We have been exposed to all of those, bought a bunch of them, look, use the free ones. And then we still end up building websites with our own layouts. And we, it&#39;s, and we perhaps just look at those for design inspiration sometimes. I think, oh, that&#39;s quite a nice, but I&#39;m not gonna actually use that row because it&#39;s got this problem, or it&#39;s not really, it, looks completely different than the rest of my raise, but I&#39;ll take some ideas from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I think that&#39;s one of the problems with design systems, off the shelf is not all of them, but, they can suffer from having a, an agenda that is based around them getting sold as opposed to long term solving the problem. Nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s, they do some good, but I just think that&#39;s why so many of them just don&#39;t, don&#39;t succeed perhaps. I know when you look at a lot of the template packs within WordPress, they have to, their agenda has to be bling. They have to appeal to the person who can&#39;t design, let&#39;s say, who needs to look like they can. And we&#39;ll be like, oh, that looks cool. I&#39;ll just grab that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, and that&#39;s why you see some absolutely horrendous websites that look like, do you know those, that those kids toys where you ma match the different head body clothes and, you can put like the, put a skirt at the bottom and then a top hat at the top. So you get this kind of thing that the, somebody just doesn&#39;t realize is a complete Frankenstein website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so me, I&#39;m probably doing custom to, but I. Using, using a system that locks me into how I have to use it. But I&#39;m probably essentially trying to create my own ones that work for me. So I&#39;m, eating my own dog foods, I think is it or whatever, but creating systems that work for me and then distributing them to a few other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. but I&#39;m totally taking influence from other things that I see. for instance, within the WordPress space, I think one that does quite well is, I think there&#39;s a theme called Ollie. Is it Ollie? That&#39;s right. Ollie. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right. Yep. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:56] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; And they&#39;ve had to work very hard to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to reduce, I assume what they&#39;re trying to do is they&#39;ve got a product and the big challenge they&#39;ve got is that they, the system that their, website is built on is the Gutenberg block editor, which has tons of cognitive dissident for end users. So people go into it, hearing all the hype, and then they bounce off and then they go straight back to Elementor or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Alias had to work very Ollie. the theme alias had to work, and the team now have had to work very hard to try to onboard customers who then they hope will find this totally usable. Make sense? Because the UX is very good in the templates that they provide. The onboarding is very good, and so they&#39;re trying to create like a good experience to stop people from bouncing back to elemental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you look at their templates, you can see that they&#39;ve put a lot of thought into it to try and stop people from failing at the first hurdle, compared to templates that you&#39;ll see elsewhere. yeah. My, just for, information, what it is that, when you&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m creating things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a number of systems that I&#39;ve been creating. They definitely wouldn&#39;t tick all the boxes of the, hardcore elite, design system gurus. They&#39;ll be problematic in all sorts of ways, but there&#39;s probably three different levels of, that I&#39;ve been doing. The one that I&#39;m doing at the moment is for Beaver Builder, and it&#39;s because Beaver Builder has the ability to have global colors and variables and stuff like that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can now build a kind of wire frame type set that is built around purposes, like I said, on the government. Website. So the purpose of this route or this page is to achieve this and that, page will have patterns in it, and then it&#39;ll have patterns will have components in it that are all reusable and they are feeding their style from the style guide, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but mostly it&#39;s pattern libraries, I would say, and the component libraries are just natural to me to put into those. So that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s my favorite one because I really feel that&#39;ll be super useful to me, to use. So I know it&#39;ll be useful to other people. the other one is commercially out there not to buy, but it&#39;s with, it&#39;s for an agency who do a lot of websites within the kitchen and bathroom design industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created a design system, or you could call it a starter website. Essentially it could be called a design system. And that means that they internally no longer have to come to me every time they want to launch a website. I just deploy the system. And I&#39;ve trained people who are not web developers and designers to build websites, and they are building whenever they&#39;ve tried to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this, they were building, Frankenstein websites that they thought look fantastic and their clients love too because they were letting their clients tell them what to do and everyone was happy and they got paid, but the customers weren&#39;t buying for the kitchens. now they&#39;re making, websites that look really cool and have a following all of the templates and are based on all the things that we learned for the last four years, developing kitchen websites, kitchen design company websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they&#39;re able to deploy these websites in a couple of days. And now they&#39;re design systeming their content as well, if that&#39;s possible. so because they know now, okay, when we have a page that has a showroom is about the showroom, we have two things. We have a company that has one showroom or we have a client that has multiple showrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we deal with a company that has multiple showrooms. This is how we deal with a company that only has one showroom. So that will then mean that when they have multiple showrooms, there&#39;ll be a choice page, which showroom do you want to go to? And then that will lead to the page, which is the, this is a showroom page, which tends to be all about telling a story of how beautiful your experience is gonna be when you come in and have a coffee, rever us and sit down and have a look and try out the different appliances and blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that&#39;s the second one. And the third one is a template set that is based on a content. Copywriting, copywriting framework. I won&#39;t say which one it is &#39;cause I probably get in trouble. but it&#39;s loosely based on, a copywriting framework. that basically is another in ingredient to these design systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got the end use, you, then you&#39;ve got, where does the words come from? And then you&#39;ve got the design aspects. So I&#39;ve mixed it up and I don&#39;t have one yet that is all three of these things, but that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to work to at some point. But I think that&#39;s why if you really want a good design system, perhaps you start off the shelf for your inspiration and then start creating your custom one that is adapted from the things that you&#39;re learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&#39;s the right way to do it. &#39;cause if it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s gonna be a total waste of time for everybody. There&#39;s a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; bit of all three there, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:42] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s really interesting what you&#39;re talking about. the thing you didn&#39;t mention is that StoryBrand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:49] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s the word I was trying not to mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause I think if you use StoryBrand, you were supposed to pay a license to StoryBrand. So I don&#39;t think it was that one David. Actually, I think it was something similar StoryBrand, but it was, I built a system that uses, an idea similar to StoryBrand in which is based loosely also on the, what is called the, pain agitation solution system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes. So define the pain that the customer is feeling why they would want their product. agitate that a little bit. What is the problem that will happen to them if they don&#39;t do something about this? This doesn&#39;t have to be a negative thing. It can be that you are missing out on the amazing thing that can be the agitation and then the solution as you present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the thing that you offer that takes, that turns &#39;em from the loser that they are, if they don&#39;t go with your product to the absolute hero that they will be if they buy it. And then you provide evidence of other people who were losers before they chose your amazing product and are now massive heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, I think some of the technical design systems, are design and code focused. And then when you hit the, when the rubber hits the road, you have end users and you have, how should we communicate to those end users? And that&#39;s why I think like a design system needs to be a bit looser and include end user goals, business goals, and a copywriting, direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. What are you, what&#39;s the, what&#39;s the consistent tone of voice that you can have throughout this? And we&#39;ve, StoryBrand, for instance, it&#39;s, always about making the end user feel like the hero. Yeah, so if, if you say, we&#39;re using StoryBrand, this design system, and here are our end user goals, then everyone can get on board who&#39;s involved, and you can even communicate it to a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found things like using StoryBrand or paying Agitation solutions super useful when I&#39;m going into a Zoom meeting with five different stakeholders from a company who&#39;ve all gonna have opinions, but I frame the whole meeting around, let&#39;s just do it like this. And then they all love it because they can all contribute to that and they can contribute to how we make the user feel like a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can all contribute to how we, I identify the pain that the user has got or the customer&#39;s got before they buy the product. And it really helps get people on board. And then when I show them a wire frame or a design using a secret design system that I&#39;ve got for them, they see what they said reflected in the design rather than.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, if five people are all disagreeing, when you show those five people the design, they&#39;re all gonna disagree on the design because they didn&#39;t see, each of them saw the thing that they disagreed about in there. I dunno where I was going with that, but, essentially it was the, I think you&#39;ve gotta have an inclusive design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise, you&#39;re not gonna get buy-in from the stakeholders that will need to sign off on it and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okie doke. I think that was a full investigation of that part, wasn&#39;t it? Should we, should we move on to the potential benefits? David, you ready for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Okay. I&#39;ve just, I&#39;ll just jump in. I just thought that was quite interesting &#39;cause that&#39;s not Yeah. Definitely what you are describing. There is something that I think you need, this system, but it&#39;s not included in what, what the articles I look at say what makes up a no design system and that, a kind of copywriting system goes in your design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all part and parcel of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:24] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of, one of the ones that are built is, yeah. Starts with that because a major problem for web designers and end user clients is tone of voice and how they communicate. So you could throw a load of call elements at a page that have got a fantastic design system in there, but, You might just be doing that based on that you thought it looked cool. so it, if you use a system like StoryBrand, it takes you, it tells you your top row should be, your top, line should be a, unique value proposition. your second line should outline in very brief bullet points, the key benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third line, the third row outlines the problem and possibly agitation in the same row. So you have this kind of, so I need to do a unique value proposition. What are my possible design patterns and components to do that? Yeah. And the obvious one is gonna be like a hero banner and then a design component of that is gonna be a heading, but it shouldn&#39;t just say the name of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the design system, in my opinion, should include a. the, big heading isn&#39;t just a H one HML tag that&#39;s big. It is that HML tag should have a point to it, which is to convince somebody if they only read that one heading on the entire website before they decided to bounce or click forward, that it also told them the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to me, like content and the end user goals is totally part of the design, but I don&#39;t see that included in a lot of the sort of more academic talking around design systems because it&#39;s, a design industry talking about it. So whereas, whereas I have to hit the, meet the rubber where it hits the road and deal with CEOs and opinionated marketing execs and cousins of the CEO or nephews and nieces and all that sort of stuff, and I have to try and keep them on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that I don&#39;t retire from the project with an excuse if something came up because I&#39;ve lost complete control. So I have to say, that&#39;s why I think, bringing some of those elements would be really useful to design. And I think gov the UK government does that to this extent. With, its, with, its the purpose of this one is this, they don&#39;t necessarily, they even give the content examples, because, especially for these more transactional sort of things that you should say this and these are the words that you can say, I think it&#39;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, I think that&#39;s a, fabulous site. And I think that the US have pretty much adopted this kind of thing. How, I my understanding is that the US kind of went more down the, whole react route and it lost money. I think there&#39;s a sort sense that when you are losing billions as they do, you, they&#39;ve had to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an agile way, and they have to work, to these kind of more fundamental systems that, start with a html first approach to everything, in terms of the technicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:36] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. I think this just highlights it. Just, stay on that reacting just for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:43] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; think, this is possibly what you think as well, but it&#39;s certainly what I think is that as soon as the, concept of web components became tied verbally to react or similar, so it is like, what JavaScript library do you use to create your web components?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out of the conversation at that point. I, they, I was lost to it because I&#39;m not really a JavaScript developer and, but I, but think how many other stakeholders downstream of. And not very good JavaScript developer are now completely out of the conversation of loss control. So it just made this, to me, this, and I think this is what W three C has identified, that, as soon as this kind of culture of JavaScript libraries got mixed up with design systems, it made, web dev high, highly skilled web developers, gatekeepers Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, decision making. Yeah. And it seems that was the wrong way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Going so high level really, that you lost it. And then, and I think now as we become more. conscious of accessibility and getting back to that web, that it should serve all people. That&#39;s its unique selling point above all of the mediums is the fact that anyone with a computer then can adapt it and get the same information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s truly inclusive and that got lost. When all your developers and all the people are thinking about JavaScript first they skip over to, then they find something to solve CSS maybe Tailwind that will plug in. That&#39;s a system that will work. And then, the last thing they&#39;re learning then is HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we learn more, HTML doesn&#39;t cover us full accessibility. We need to learn a little bit of Aria to get there. And and I think that&#39;s where I like those kind of, like you say with the UK ones, because they have to start from that basis of inclusivity. Yep. So it builds up on those foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:51:45] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mix seems really, thought out. And, inclusion inclusionary, if that&#39;s a word. it is now. It is, yeah. It makes sense in my context. I think with the ARIA tags and the h, like you say, the H ml tags that get you to 80% and then the aria takes you over the line to truly define what this content is, as opposed to with the JavaScript route, which you sometimes can&#39;t even see the content behind the scenes, it&#39;s dynamically changing in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:25] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; and, it&#39;s, yeah. Yeah. Let&#39;s move on. Sorry. Okay. No, that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; fine. That&#39;s absolutely fine. a couple of sections we&#39;ve got left, so potential benefits and finally considerations. potential benefits have been listed out as follows. We&#39;ll just, I&#39;ll just read them out and then we can Yeah, you can explore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are as follows, four things Dave has listed. Efficiency and cost saving, reducing tedious tasks, maintaining quality or reducing errors. And finally reducing staff dependency through documentation. I suppose they&#39;re all fairly self-explanatory, but do we wanna open those up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I think we&#39;ll go on to the considerations, which I think the next thing, there are benefits obviously, if you can have some sort of system that you, that&#39;s really what I feel like I&#39;m trying to work out is a way of avoiding errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get into looking at everything I put on a website, I&#39;m, I made the no script show one, and I&#39;m, but going back on it, re correcting things as I go through this series on components here. &#39;cause I realize, oh, I forgot about this. Oh, yeah. It&#39;s it&#39;s getting built. but yeah, so I think there&#39;s something to have some documentation even for yourself that reminds you of when you do certain things, even if it is, as I say, what we&#39;ll do next time ahead of which you don&#39;t even see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, one thing that did cross my mind, with style guides and branding, I said earlier and I think this is open for question now. a company might need a, some, something might stay there in terms of a style guide and it might be a permanent thing. But I question this these days because we are moving so rapidly towards this idea of users choosing their own journey on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;light and dark mode is the one that&#39;s taking off the most that you even that isn&#39;t so true these days if we&#39;re moving forward with this idea that there are different presentations for different types of users, depending on their own preference of how they want to consume the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:33] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; it sounded like led into the first two points actually quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. So let&#39;s go through those then. Yeah. So the considerations, first of all, long term efficiency in an ever changing industry. Second one where design consistently stifles creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, how do we build the right foundations again, because it&#39;s your, both of you have significantly more experience. It&#39;s over to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:59] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I say something about these? These actually, so David, your approach is. Much more resilient to point number one, long-term efficiency in an ever-changing industry where you are going as deep as the H TM L code and the aria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when this comes back to this whole lifespan of a design system, most of the systems I&#39;m using should all page builders suddenly disappear. At least I can take some of the thinking and then apply it to HTML and I&#39;ll be one step behind you on the tech, but I can probably get there, in time, given time sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this ever changing industry, it&#39;s not even really the, the industry is like us, we are the people who make this stuff right. But to me, I think the, like the word industry could be interchangeable with, the, I dunno what the word is actually, but, so for, instance, web, currently we use website in a browser and that&#39;s how we look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or on a phone. And then content now is, can be fed into things like apple, newsreader, those sort of things. So basically some of the websites I would make would not farewell in some of these situations where content needs to adapt to a different device or something that isn&#39;t a web browser. Everything I&#39;m doing is assumed that it is been consumed, probably on a web browser or a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browser. Okay. Yeah. whereas, I can totally see that, especially with ai. I know that this is controversial, topic as such, but if it gets to the point where you don&#39;t even really look at websites anymore. We spoke about this on the last one, I think, where you just say, Hey, where basically websites are made on the fly in some kind of, they&#39;re made in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you ask something about, Hey, can you tell me about what&#39;s the best fender guitar from the JA made in Japan in the eighties? Chat. GPT will currently give you a kind of chat about that at the moment, but it&#39;s not an inconceivable that at some point it will create a custom webpage for you that you just look at as if that page had been made with pictures and videos and all that sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would, you would imagine it would need to be able to query its sources and see h TM L tags, find aria, attributes and stuff like that. And it would only really pull in that content where it was confident that it was the correct content because it could see how it was marked up. It&#39;s not gonna go to, one of my websites where a client has told me to put this over here and make this thing flying over there and then this popup comes up or something because it&#39;s just too much chaos and noise for a future device to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think, The, gov website is perfect example again because you can see that those elements could transfer into other devices that we don&#39;t yet know that people want to use. So you could equally, they could plug an API into chat GBT for instance, and have you pay your, council tax straight fire, via chat EBT if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that&#39;s where we&#39;ll end up going. That different systems will just be plugging into things and APIs and, the current SME and charity and nonprofit sector is gonna struggle with that because we&#39;re all stuck in that sector, both the clients and the people serving it like me in this relatively short term view of everybody wants to go to your website and a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make a website for a web browser and when it becomes a problem, they&#39;ll ask me to make a system that works in chat GPT so they can, do you know what I mean? but we&#39;ll be playing catch up massively at that point. David, your approach of thinking about this HML structure. you might not have the content that chat, GPT or whatever system wants to pull in, but at least you&#39;ll have the structure correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it can understand and interpret and know, oh, basically here&#39;s some prices of those guitars that you want and it&#39;ll put it in a component pricing table and it&#39;ll know to recommend this guitar and it&#39;ll have a pricing table, right? That isn&#39;t even from a website. It&#39;s just gone does this Mexican guitar, USA Fender and then the Japanese one recommended with a little tag on it, most popular for people who are thinking like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is presented as a pricing table with benefits and stuff like that. so I think that&#39;s I think that we&#39;ll see the ever changing to me is that everything&#39;s gonna be much more dynamic and on the fly using components and patterns that are marked up. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:59:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we would probably, That&#39;s, I don&#39;t like the idea that, that search engines are now providing the ai, I feel they are. It&#39;s broken, the deal with people, because at the end of the day, it&#39;s making us dependent on our content, stolen our content. Basically, AI is stolen everybody&#39;s work. And it&#39;s remarketed to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll ever be able to. I think the more you get into, the skill of writing a website, I&#39;ve only become more appreciative of this recently, particularly as you get into the accessibility, because there isn&#39;t. machine isn&#39;t gonna quite do it because it has to make d you have to make decisions about how you will label your aria or where you will label it a, according to your imagined audience for the content and the different circumstances that they might be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to imagine that anything will automatically, do that. We&#39;ll be able to present random content and get that right, not if CloudFlare has got anything to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:00:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; because CloudFlare is, providing a system to block your website from AI bots. Yeah. Unless you pay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s like a paywall for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It&#39;s just hot off the press. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we, we can, if there is a set of rules, but I think this is always where we want to go with design systems and it&#39;s even with ai, it&#39;s my thought on things at the moment. It&#39;s a very materialistic view of the world where you think that everything can be explained if we get down to a certain set of materials that we understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously when we&#39;ve got Jeffrey Hinton, the sort of godfather of AI now panicking about, general intelligence, as a reality, I don&#39;t know if it ever will be. Obviously it poses a threat to us. Depending on how we use it. This is another conversation here. Yeah. This is complete, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ton of words, but it&#39;s in the same with the, design systems. I think, the idea that we&#39;re seeing certain things are making us feel like this is going to provide the solution. Like we&#39;re not far away from Google. That it can now grab the information and it&#39;s really useful in that, and now it&#39;ll be able to present it in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&#39;t believe that&#39;s ever going to be the case,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:02:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in, the same way that in physics there&#39;s always this, there&#39;s always this rush to, there&#39;s always this idea that you&#39;ll get this grand unified theory. It feels a bit like that&#39;s what we&#39;re describing here, this grand unified theory of what the internet is and what design is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe it&#39;ll never. being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:02:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; achieved. it&#39;s always a problem. And, for people like Jeffrey Hinton or Materialists who explain things, so they say, I can explain everything in science and this is how it works. And then you go, yeah, but okay, so I explain the body and you go, yeah, but why do I think, why am I conscious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they go, that&#39;s just, phenomenal. Don&#39;t worry about that. Forget that worry. We&#39;ve solved it. The whole thing about having a conscious conscience is, or consciousness is, irrelevant to this conversation. And I think sometimes that&#39;s how you get, when you look at things scientifically, when you comes to the art of communication via the web, we start to think, it will serve the stuff, but will it really communicate with real human conscious beings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I never quite convinced, I always think that it&#39;s just a bunch of scientists thinking they&#39;re going to nail this. There&#39;s, a formula here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; We will, we&#39;ll probably revisit this topic in two years time when our robot overlords have taken over. Yes. And, we will just be simulations because we&#39;ve been scraped on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you think we&#39;ve achieved what we set out to achieve? Are we at the end of that episode, do you imagine? Or is there more to say? I think we&#39;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:44] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; still confused as, as ever. Yeah. But, that&#39;s never, but we,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s never gonna change. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:52] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s &#39;cause we&#39;re normal, people. But, the, that consistency stifles creativity on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. that&#39;s an interesting one to me. &#39;cause I don&#39;t think consistency ever does stifle creativity. I think, I think, just, mashing things up and throwing them all over a page isn&#39;t creativity. It&#39;s just, I. It just, it gives, it&#39;s like a, gaslighting version of creativity that some that, an end user doesn&#39;t appreciate, but the owner of the website appreciates more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s, web design, consistency stage creativity. I don&#39;t think it starts create creativity. I think design consistency helps to get rid of, vanity aspects nicely. You can still be totally cre creative. You shouldn&#39;t just be, you shouldn&#39;t fail to be creative if you&#39;ve got consistency. so I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:04:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds like a great meme. Yeah. There you go. We&#39;ll probably parcel that off as the, as the, little, the bit that this episode goes out under. I will try to, I&#39;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:05:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; try to make that happen. No, I think that&#39;s what you do quite well on it because of the fact that you&#39;ve do got a design system where you&#39;ve got row and they&#39;re spaced out in a logical way because you are using a lot of your own CSS to make sure that s space is consistent through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And for users, there is a, certainly if you understand the, how people perceive space and what they mean to them, this, it drives us mad and we can tell a bad design because they&#39;ve used the page builder and just drop something in and it&#39;s, half a centimeter off or something, how it was on the other page and it&#39;s jarring and we know this, and that kind of consistency helps us with our perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think sometimes that consistency in a different way, a consistency of doing things in a certain way, then leads to. as we can see with design, they, we might have thought we&#39;ve got the perfect design in 2000 or something, and none of them look like that any longer. unless we&#39;re doing it for comedic effect, So we constantly change. So I think that&#39;s the problem with the design system. You build a whole load of layouts that you&#39;re going to use, and you just think these were just web layouts, then they don&#39;t, some, that&#39;s more interesting thing that you&#39;ll see in print and in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:06:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am gonna knock it on the head in that case. At that point. so that was episode number 22, or at least you can find it at no script show slash 22. You can head to the URL there and hopefully you will be able to find the relevant show notes there. it only remains for me to, to say thank you to, to Paul for joining us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, thanks Paul. I appreciate your, your contributions to the debate today. That&#39;s great. So we&#39;ll see you on the next one. Thanks guys. Yeah, you&#39;re very welcome. See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Here &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; tags are changed to &amp;lt;button&amp;gt; tags when JS loads. The hamburger works as a modal dialog which traps the user within it by default. The last option escape the modal via the last focusable item. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Until a month ago, I&#39;ve not seen anyone using this for navigation menus. It seems to work with only a few lines of JS, but I have not tested it emough to cover here. Improvement is needed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simpler-navigation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/simple-navigation/&quot;&gt;Simpler Navigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This video is a follow up to our podcast episode on website navigation. You can find that at no script show slash 21. The numbers two and one here. We&#39;re looking at some examples and their code. And the links for these can be found at no script show slash learn, forward slash 13. And again, the numbers one three joined as always by David Waumlsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. Oh so this one, we&#39;re concentrating on the accessibility on the audio. We were talking about everything really to do with navigation and we concluded that being the no script show. We try and avoid hide and show with JavaScript as much as possible. But I thought for this, I should at least show some examples of accessible ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course these are by other people because I. I can&#39;t write JavaScript, okay. I&#39;ll just go through a few examples. So the first one, which we mentioned in the audio, was from the web accessibility initiative. They&#39;ve got some great examples if anyone does need what they call flyout menus with the JavaScript that you can use for these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are, as you say, there&#39;s all these different variations, like somewhere you can get to the sub menu via the, little icon on the side. And as you can see on this, it works if you hover to open up the side menu. So it&#39;s a link as well as a sort of hover state on the, yeah. Little icon. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the, they&#39;ve got that. when you, if you are a tabbing along, then you&#39;ll tab to each and then tab to that one, it&#39;ll drop it. So screen readers and, people using keyboards will, treat this differently. So this is a really useful resource, but what I will say about this is I probably wouldn&#39;t use it because I think I&#39;m quite a fan of the idea of progressive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you disabled JavaScript or it doesn&#39;t load for people, none of these work. So it&#39;s accessible. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; basically all of those, yeah, they&#39;ve gone from the world if you don&#39;t have JavaScript. yep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. So they&#39;re worth checking out as, examples if that&#39;s what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s the downside as, as far as I &#39;cause it. Also, the other downside of it is that there isn&#39;t an example if you just want a copy and paste of CSS that makes this good for mobile. So it will just squeeze, I won&#39;t, squeeze it in, but as you can imagine, when they squeeze in, so space and bear will just get squashed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So it&#39;s just using flexbox. So there isn&#39;t really a, an attractive design element to that. A useful resource. The other thing, and he&#39;s brilliant, I&#39;ve mentioned it before on the show, Manuel, Matovich, he just easy for you to say it&#39;s not, and I&#39;m sure I said it wrong, but he&#39;s wonderful. And the way he presents stuff, he&#39;s done some great CSS day talks and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s got a book called Accessibility Cookbook, which is really easy to consume. You can just take different bits out of it on this one. but in a way he is, and I&#39;ll go to his examples. Now, you can actually steal these examples without getting the book I&#39;ve been reading through the book, which is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his examples, let me just see if I can find them here, are all available on his, accessibility cookbook.com site where the code is. And he is got a few examples he builds up on it. So there&#39;s this one where you&#39;ve got all the code that you need, including the JavaScript and CSS for an example, which you can find on Code Pen, which I&#39;ll show you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this looks a bit ugly, you would need to do more with it. But basically when you are there, we are, we&#39;ve got normal menu and when we yep, click on there, we get ju with CSS, we&#39;ve got an icon, hamburger icon, and then a menu here. And pretty straightforward JavaScript. And of course this is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a little bit janky the animation on this. But it works. Again, it&#39;s the progressive enhancement on this side. That means that I probably wouldn&#39;t use it. I know he is a big fan of progressive enhancement, but again, it&#39;s accessible. But if you are worried about JavaScript not loading or loading slowly, then, that&#39;s maybe not the option to go with for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s that one. Now, okay, now we move into Sarah Sewer. Dan&#39;s, if I&#39;m saying her name right as well, I dunno, a practical accessibility course. she&#39;s brilliant and she is so meticulous over everything. So of course hers have been progressively enhanced and she goes through the whole process of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can just show you a few examples of her. So we, she starts off where we look at a, there&#39;s a. That&#39;s her course. she is brilliant. She&#39;s a bit of a, party pooper for those people who just love to do everything with CSS &#39;cause she points out how things might not be accessible if you don&#39;t add in JavaScript under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So there&#39;s this first, it&#39;s clickable, not hover. &#39;cause she&#39;s not a fan of that. And it&#39;s a fairly, I&#39;m not gonna go into the details here, but the, JavaScript gets a little bit more because she&#39;s progressively enhanced it. So if I were to, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll do it anyway. I, if this will work well because I know that CodePen, we can&#39;t see whatever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with that browser extension, but I&#39;m guessing you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; are disabling JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. You can&#39;t see that you are. I am doing that Uhhuh. And if I just refresh on this, yeah, code pen requires JavaScript, but I think it work anyway. Ah, yes it does. So we can&#39;t see our code now, but what we can see is. The state. Oh, yeah. When JavaScript fails. Yeah. So yeah, so what she does is that she builds progressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as she will, instead of using the button as the dropdown for something, she will use a span and then use the JavaScript to add in and change that role to a button. interesting. Yeah. Okay. But of course it makes, and I&#39;m now, which you can&#39;t see, I&#39;m now going to turn off my, disabling of JavaScript on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s a better solution. But then of course everything gets a little bit more complex with this. And let me move on to a next example where she, has the normal menu over here. Yeah. And then a drop down on the navigation for when we get to mobile sizes. Gosh, that&#39;s really neat. It is really neat. but again, even when you are as meticulous as she is about getting absolutely everything right and progressively hands it, there are still some like decisions you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she, she&#39;s done two here, she&#39;s done this, what is called as a design pattern. The draw, where the, overlay comes over the top and she&#39;s using changing things to dialogue role. And when you do that, you are trapped. So she calls this trapped and I&#39;m, if I could just show it on there. If I just move around here, you are trapped in that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; dialogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you, you have to, what? You have to click engage, there&#39;s no sort of escape functionality in the menu. That&#39;s, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you need to have a close here to be able to close this. so there is another alternative that she&#39;s made on this one. We&#39;re not trapped where if I just go into this again, we are using, it goes into the role of dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens on this one is you get to the last focusable item. It will take you out automatically. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a bit of swings and roundabouts there. I can see why that&#39;s good, but also why that&#39;s bad. Yeah. So you have to engage it every time you go through it. So if you miss a link, you&#39;ve gotta start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yeah. and I think this is the thing, what she will say on that, it will depend on your pattern and your research on this and, but it just shows you different, as we were talking about on the first thing, when you start to get into this, you can never quite get it right for everybody, can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Because somebody&#39;s gonna be expecting one set of behavior and they won&#39;t know as they go to different sites, which is made me, obviously her course is absolutely brilliant. She&#39;s really meticulous. But here&#39;s the thing. I am not, I. I&#39;m quite happy to do a little bit of JavaScript if I understand it, but I&#39;m not going through, this, rigmarole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Look at all that. That&#39;s a lot. That is a lot. Yeah. Yeah. To change. So I&#39;ll avoid it. But these are great examples. And maybe I&#39;ll use &#39;em one day on this. I will, just because of the fact that she puts things into a dialogue role, I will show something, which is, might shame me later, but I did experiment some years back with my own sort of way of imitating, mega menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;ll just, okay. I dunno if I didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think I clicked this right. No, you didn&#39;t. I just added it at the end &#39;cause I had it. &#39;cause I, maybe I&#39;ll get into this at some point, but what I&#39;ve done here is just on a regular menu, but I&#39;ve created this mega menu. Yeah. With the dialogue. You can have show modal, which is what it&#39;s designed for, and you can have just show where it will stick to the element that&#39;s near there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually you can still move around, things here, so it actually works. Now, I don&#39;t know, this is something where you might want to get a friend of yours, Joe Dawson, to look at and say, how terrible is this? I, know I need to fix some things, but it does actually work. it is enclosed because it&#39;s dialogue, but I&#39;ve gotta close so I can close it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. may, maybe we need to get Joe on this show and he can we can line up all of the previous websites that you&#39;ve ever made and be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know there were things wrong with this, but it&#39;s an interesting thing because I have not, I did this a couple of years ago because I was excited by the fact that we now had, dialogue, which we could use a little bit, how we&#39;re excited about details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I thought, can I use &#39;em for a menu? I dunno, I could not find a single person until last month. I have not seen a single person use it for a menu. And then you found one Rejoice. Yes. I, found some one, but they made the, actually I could show you on this. I won&#39;t show you on, I will actually, let me just do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to disable the JavaScript. &#39;cause what they didn&#39;t do, which at least I did do on this, is if I disabled the JavaScript, I put in a link now which goes to a site map. So you actually get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, even, okay. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That site is beautiful, by the way. It is a menu, isn&#39;t it? It is a kind of mega menu right there, the way you&#39;ve laid it out with columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You might not wanna get stuck down. No, there&#39;s a lot there. Something post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh. Yeah. So it might need improving for accessibility if your JavaScript breaks. So honestly, I don&#39;t know, it was just a little idea that I had that I wasn&#39;t gonna show, but I might work on it and see if there&#39;s something that can be done with it as a, if you do feel that you ever need it, if this can be, because it&#39;s so easy to do, it&#39;s just a few lines of JavaScript to get things to open because you&#39;re relying on hasty ml to do most of the work you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s really interesting. I like that. That&#39;s pretty neat. Yeah. And the CSS is easy &#39;cause you can just put it in a grid and it automatically moves. Yeah. yeah, I was quite pleased with it, but very nervous to show it to anyone because I just, there it is and it&#39;s gone. Yeah. But very easy if you put them in a grid to make it mobile responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it really, simple as I like it. Okay. So talk as simple. Should we go on to just talk about what we&#39;ve used on this site and what I&#39;ll be trying to get away with? So I&#39;ve, can I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just say, just for the sake of clarity, what you have used, this is not me. This is you. You&#39;ve done all this hard work, so don&#39;t give me the credit for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, you can avoid the shame as well that goes, I dunno about that. Yeah. okay. So there are some things, even when we&#39;re keeping it simple with h ml, CSS and Aria, there are some things that we probably need to, so I&#39;ve used on the intrinsic. Frameworks are the links there on my show notes there, and I&#39;ll put our own site in here just so I can show stuff on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is pretty straightforward on this, so I&#39;m just using Flex as most people do, because it, it sizes according to, the item, the menu item. all pretty similar here, but obviously Grid does it the other ways, puts boxes around it. So this is a pretty simple thing. I won&#39;t, I haven&#39;t put all the CSS code that&#39;s going into there, but obviously at a break point it just goes down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&#39;re sticking to something like five here, this will go down to, before it breaks and wraps again, it will go down to a screen of, I think 3, 7, 5 pixels, maybe three 50 or pretty small, so most, yeah. Yeah. So most mobiles are gonna get this. So without having to bring in a hamburger. We&#39;ve got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we showed before, what we have on this is on the mo. it takes you to where we&#39;ve got more straight to the navigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And with some&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; animation that goes on that. So that&#39;s it. And here&#39;s a couple of things that probably you&#39;ll get different information on if you are into accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve put the HTML code up here. Now once we put nav, once we use the nav, which we should to put our ur and, that&#39;s an important thing as well. If you&#39;re showing and hiding, never hide the whole nav else, otherwise it disappears from the table of contents. So that&#39;s really, so that&#39;s another thing you could make a mistake with, but we&#39;re not doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even even though we&#39;ve got nav, we might have more than one nav on a site. So we can use Aria label to say main. So it&#39;s, no, it&#39;s the main navigation. Got it. And I don&#39;t, I haven&#39;t written navigation because screen readers will announce that it&#39;s navigation. They&#39;ll know navigation main. So I put an Aria label of Main on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another thing to make things better all the time is to use Aria current for the users who, are without visual clues on what to look. So when you&#39;re on that particular page on, that AAG that you are using there, you&#39;ll put r current equals page. Yeah. for home on that one. That&#39;s a kind of good thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what I&#39;ve done here as I&#39;m showing you on our example, is. The names are different on here, but the link to the footer, another key thing to do is if you are an icon, which I&#39;m just using in the HCML, unit over here, put that to Hidden True, if you want that as an indicator, because you don&#39;t want that to be read out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen reader would read that out as down, downward triangle. Yeah. most of them would anyway, and then put an Aria label, which explains to them, because it&#39;s not so obvious visually for them to see. I&#39;ve put an Aria label in there saying that we&#39;re navigating two links in the foot. Links in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And, likewise, when you are meeting at that other end, there&#39;s actually, you&#39;re not far away from the get back to the top as well. So hopefully it&#39;s good. I&#39;ve made some quick marks that, NAV is a landmark so you can. that&#39;s a way of being able to tell screen readers the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s eight of &#39;em that are commonly known, like a banner, which tells &#39;em it&#39;s a header, a nav within that tells &#39;em what the navs are so they can move around from it. But the interesting thing is, and this is why I&#39;ve got, I&#39;ll, just skip ahead here. Option two is because some people will say, yes, NAV is accessible because it gives them this landmark so they know where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because they&#39;re not often well laid out on most pages, people still use the majority. I think it&#39;s closer to 70% of screen reader users will go to headers. Headings rather. Headings. Yeah. Yes. And so another way of doing it is to, in your nav you put, are we labeled by? Give that an ID and then connect that up to a visually hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;title which same main navigation on there. So some people sort That makes sense. Yeah. Will do that. Now the experts that I&#39;ve been following haven&#39;t been doing that with their head or text. They&#39;ve been using what I&#39;ve used in the first one, which is just used the RRE label. Now mostly they will say, this is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we? A label buy is better because of translation issues because of the way that screen readers will find things. Aria label is your last resort. If the HTML can say it, that&#39;s best if, are we a label buy is your next go-to. And then are we a label last? And the reason why I&#39;ve gone to Aria label and why I think they have too is because on the main menu you&#39;re probably likely to know in the head of that is the main navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also then you fall foul of the Of the has ml, which is usually in your main, should come first. You put a header before your header one if you like. It&#39;s fascinating,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; like these overlapping and con and slightly conflicting ways of achieving. Yes. It, and it sounds like there&#39;s no perfect way to, to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just, slightly better given the proclivities of the website you&#39;re working on. Yeah. That is really interesting. I, did not know what you&#39;ve just explained. Gosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. No, I didn&#39;t. And I, I got different experts and they told me, oh, you should do this. And then I thought, hang on, I&#39;ve got a head of two now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above my head are one, what&#39;s going on? And, Generally, I don&#39;t think it matters, it doesn&#39;t spoil your dumb order in any way. It&#39;s only, that kind of role. It&#39;s probably not the biggest thing. But of course if you are, checking some of these things, if you are using checkers, it&#39;s really annoying to have this flagged up that you&#39;ve got your yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headers in the wrong order, even though it&#39;s visually hidden. sorry, so I went off a little bit on this one. One thing to just mention as well, because if you are not up to date, which I wasn&#39;t, you&#39;ll hear some people say that you need to put the role of list in a nav for Safari users because Safari decided not to feature nut bug, but they thought that lists were overused in design, so they decided not to announce &#39;em to screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are. So they discount your role of lists. So an order ordered or ordered list. So discounted them. They&#39;ve changed this only quite recently. So if it&#39;s a list within a nav, they will read out how many items are in that. Okay. Alright. Yeah. So we don&#39;t need to do that, but you might see it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made a point about that. what else? Oh, there was a slight subnote on this and I dunno, I&#39;ve gone my own route with this one. I dunno how people, I, see people done this differently, but you get an issue like this on this page and it&#39;s not so much on this one, but I want this to have some CSS that tells me that this is the current section that I&#39;m in, in my main menu, but I&#39;m actually in an article within the component section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want a breadcrumb soft style thing, don&#39;t you? But not probably. Yeah. But I thought there&#39;s not many levels here. So what, I&#39;ve done, and I, won&#39;t open up the inspector, but basically what I&#39;ve done where we&#39;ve got that, I put Aria, oh, current, not page, but true to say that&#39;s where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an Aria label saying, currently viewing a single post on the components. And that&#39;s the same on the no script show as well. So if you go into our chats and you go into an individual chat, it will tell you that it&#39;s a, post on the chats. So that was my. Work around. I&#39;m just throwing it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No one&#39;s given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you, sorry to get into the technical weeds of this 11 t, the, CMS management tool that enables you to do that, does it, it can figure out that this is a page under the, tree if you like, the parent of components and then it will build that area label for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I had to put that sort of as a bit of programming in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. To make sure that it did it when it knows which one it&#39;s on. So Yeah. Interesting. New&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; idea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; though. I like it. That&#39;s going the extra mile. It feels. Yeah. I did have a look at, Andy Bell&#39;s site and I noticed when had a sort of similar situation. He just, it was still the CSS styling was active there, but it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just thought this was a bit of extra information. Yeah. Maybe, I&#39;ve made it more busy for screen readers. I don&#39;t know, but Rather than have breadcrumbs where, they&#39;re only going one level deep. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that helpful, Okay. Okay. Yeah, it&#39;s just my, yeah, I know you get into a lot on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s not. Did I miss anything on there? I don&#39;t think I did. I didn&#39;t cover the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; CSS yet. Yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, there&#39;s not much to say. I can&#39;t cover it &#39;cause it&#39;s in the context of the header, but we&#39;re using Flex with Flex To make then that pretty good for headers in most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just put in some code here, which is showing how I&#39;m styling the underline when we&#39;re under that section so it&#39;s visually underlined when we&#39;re under this. Yep. So you know where you are. And then that&#39;s done with the CSS that&#39;s over here by picking out the HF and then putting, and I&#39;ve put it for now, I&#39;ve had to do it for True as well as page, Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it&#39;s now the a HF Aria current page and True as well. And then we&#39;ve used these new properties in CSS where we can actually decide the thickness of these ones and offset the underlining as well. To be honest, I might change this. this is a bit off what we were talking about because there&#39;s a really cool with view transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a border and you use view transitions, it creates that lovely effect where it feels like the border is moving along to your next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Almost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; like a Yeah, I know. I know what you mean. Like a little animation of something sliding to the next one kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; do it on this, so I might change this to a border anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get really in the weeds. Yeah. But it&#39;s a cool thing &#39;cause it used to take so much Yeah. Programming to create this sort of feeling like things anyway. Yeah. Styling a second target. Where have I put this down on there? Oh, that was just, this is just the script I&#39;ve put in because as when we hover down to, in that thing where we hovered and I highlighted, yeah, you click on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; link and it creates the border around it to Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it some focused. So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; just put, I put the styling in there that was used on that one. So we&#39;re using target. So it, that border is only showing to highlight. on the mobile it&#39;s fine because you&#39;re down to one column and everybody knows where you&#39;ve navigated to if you are going to the footer and you&#39;ve got other things in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just a way of highlighting with a bit of animation. But of course with animation, I&#39;ve also wrapped it around, no preference here, prefers reduced the amount reduced. Yeah. So if you&#39;ve, if you don&#39;t like motion, it disappears. And that&#39;s really it. I, apart from the fact that, did I put where I got it from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. There&#39;s a really great tool for animation, which is animus.net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anim, A-N-I-M-I-S-T a.net. Anim net. I Be sure you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; just, get your CSS that you want from that. what else did I want to mention there? There just notes. flex, I&#39;ve already said that contains the unit, current page we&#39;re hiding globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, a good point actually. Something I failed to on the site I just showed you is that generally globally you might want to add to your A tags and increase, amount of padding by default because of such thing as target size, which is defined for accessibility. So you can hit the thing properly. Yep, When you&#39;re on touch mobiles where it&#39;s supposed to be, I dunno why in pixels, but 24 pixels, you&#39;re supposed to have around your, click the bullying, otherwise it starts to fail and, accessible. Yeah. You have to be very precise and have a perfectly pointy finger. Yes. Yeah. But yeah, if you haven&#39;t got that thing and silks two tied pixels that up for me, although I didn&#39;t spot it on my other site where I know I didn&#39;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not always accurate, but I think that&#39;s it. Have I covered enough Cody stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Gosh, yeah, I think so. just to say that, obviously we&#39;re showing this on the screen, but it is available to you. no script show slash learn. Slash 13, the numerals one, three, no script show slash learn slash 13. Yeah, I think that&#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously we had a companion, podcast episode, which you can find at no script show slash 21, which obviously explains all of the bits and pieces that we&#39;ve been going through and why David, felt these bits of navigation were important to mention. I think that&#39;s it. Have we, captured what you wanted to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we have. Yeah. That was great. I enjoyed that. Yeah. In which case, I will see you next time. Thank you. So that was all about website navigation. Hope that you enjoyed it and we&#39;ll see you next time. Take it easy. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Website Navigation: Why is it so bloody awful?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/21/" />
    <updated>2025-06-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/21/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-website-navigation&quot;&gt;What is website navigation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list to help users find associated pages and documents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A table of content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ever-present menu bar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminology is difficult.  What some call navigation and links, others call menus and buttons. A menu to a developer has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role&quot;&gt;specific role&lt;/a&gt;. To an UX expert it may define a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-elements-glossary/#Menu-Bar&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-navigation&quot;&gt;Types of navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main link navigation (or menu bar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation activated by a &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot; icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadcrumbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on click and hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links with adjacent icons concealing dropdown sub-menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested or multi-level &amp;quot;dropdowns&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega-menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s further terminology issues here. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/&quot;&gt;Heydon Pickering&lt;/a&gt; points out &#39;dropdown&amp;quot; is behaviour we get with the HTML &amp;lt;select&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;options&amp;gt;. Some refer instead to &amp;quot;pulldowns&amp;quot;.  The W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative refers to them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#flyoutnavmousefixed&quot;&gt;fly-outs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-needed-for-website-navigation&quot;&gt;Code needed for website navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML gives us a semantic and accessible name with the &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt; element. Add in some &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags to an ordered or unordered list and we are good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add ARIA and we have an accessible way to add more navigation components on a page and tell screen readers their current page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add CSS and we can have beautiful horizontal nav bars where we can also visually indicate the current page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add JS and we can create interactive show and hide (disclosure widgets) along with many new ways to fail.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* We can hide and show with CSS, but hover menus are no use to keyboard users and difficult on touch devices.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigation-problems&quot;&gt;Navigation problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux&quot;&gt;UX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu bars often look similar, but behave differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can’t click on things we do not see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy dropdown solutions make sloppy site architecture easy too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should indicate links that go to pdfs or external sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown on hover can interrupt a user’s journey to another target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide and show options should not obscure important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disclosure widgets have an interaction cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are dropdowns becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongdesign.co/articles/tired-trend-drop-down-navigation-menus&quot;&gt;tired design pattern&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega-menus improve UX and we have seen some head turning examples such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/gb&quot;&gt;stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, but is it best way? It depends on JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API&quot;&gt;view transitions&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading&quot;&gt;speculative loading&lt;/a&gt; could move us from imitating desktop apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &amp;quot;menu&amp;quot; has a few items to avoid hamburger* clicks, but links to a second nav in the footer.The target is styles and animated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/&quot;&gt;NNG&lt;/a&gt; updated their view on hamburger menus. They found it now to be commonly reconisable if placed top left and contains 3 bars. &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;seo&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS may create search issues or be viewed as secondary content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden content could lead to less pages visited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straightforward until we try to hide and show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most checkers can&#39;t pick up on nav failures that most sites have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; can give us accessible dropdowns, but how screen readers announce them is not aways suitable and in-page search makes them stay open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the role of menu for website navigation means we have to add support for  &lt;kbd&gt;space&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;arrow →&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;Esc&lt;/kbd&gt; keys too. Generally best avoided, but there is this &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessible-mega-menu.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this was informed by Manuel Matuzović&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility-cookbook.com/&quot;&gt;Web Accessibility Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;, the Web Accessibility Initiative work and Sara Soueidan’s  &lt;a href=&quot;https://practical-accessibility.today/&quot;&gt;Practical Accessibility course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not suprisingly, the conclusion is that the No Script Show should, where possible, avoid scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This is the second in our series looking at various components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re talking about website navigation and why it&#39;s so bloody awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format for this series is that we&#39;ll first chat about the components and consider them from a UX design, accessibility, technical, and SEO perspective. Then we&#39;ll follow this audio focused episode with a short YouTube video looking at code snippets and working examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the links for those, this show can be found at no script show slash 21. That&#39;s the numerals two one, no script show slash 21. And if you want some code examples, then head to no script Show forward slash learn. Forward slash 13. So the numbers one, three. No script show slash learn forward slash 13. As always, the person that&#39;s doing the actual hard work on this podcast is David Waumsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just turn up and talk. Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:05] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. this is really interesting &#39;cause I thought, oh, I can&#39;t do menus yet. There&#39;s so much with it and there is &#39;cause we&#39;ve got a lot to get through. But it&#39;s been so fascinating because when I started trying to put some code snippets together for kind of components earlier on, I thought, oh I need this mega manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need these dropdown setups. I&#39;ve got a whole bunch of things I need. And doing this and doing a bit of research, particularly with the accessibility, I&#39;ve just ended up. Going with another instinct of mine is that we really make kind of website navigation overly complex sometimes, which is not always great for users and really hard technically to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. You&#39;ve, you&#39;ve put together a, on the webpage that I just mentioned, you&#39;ve put together a really exhaustive list of all of the bits and pieces that go into a navigation menu. Far more in all honesty than I&#39;d ever thought about. I honestly, my position prior to reading your document was just put the headline things in and then create a site map and hope that Google will surface the content and kind of forget about it there, but there&#39;s a lot more to it and it&#39;s really fascinating what you&#39;ve thrown together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I show the yeah. The, notes. Yeah. Show the, page. Okay. So here we are. So you&#39;ll be able to find this at no script show slash 21, if you want to. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; let&#39;s get into it. Yeah, the f following the format we started with last time, we, try and define what we&#39;re talking about with website navigation, and there really isn&#39;t a definition here with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could say, I&#39;ve, listed a list that helps users to find associated pages and documents because it&#39;s not always internal links. It can be external links or it can be other documents like PDFs or even some decide to attach Word documents, even menus. is it a table of contents? effectively a table of contents on a website does the same thing, but we have a perhaps, generally a different view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it an ever present menu bar? And often people call it menu. And that&#39;s, honestly, there&#39;s no real definition out there because the terminology is so difficult. I think when we start talking about website navigation, so what some people will call. Navigation links, which is what I would generally call it these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people will call menus and buttons, and I dunno about you, with clients sometimes you get this sort of mismatch of what you&#39;re talking about. They&#39;re saying the bot, the button&#39;s on the top, I need them to be, and you&#39;re thinking, oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there is no button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, I know exactly what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like obviously to you and I, we&#39;ve probably settled upon a term that you, like I use menu interchangeably with nav. Yes. I shorten navigation always to nav and and when I speak to clients very often the case was that yeah, they would just use a different. A different term, like a link or a button or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so those words are not out in the mainstream, so it&#39;s very difficult to define. But, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and I made a note here because I didn&#39;t appreciate this until I started doing this research on it. It&#39;s the fact that if you&#39;re a developer, the menu is actually a specific technical term, which means that if you use, if you mark up your, nav with menu as give it a roll of menu, then there are a whole bunch of expected behaviors that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like you should be able to use a space bar, the escapes key, the arrow keys and all of that. So it&#39;s actually technically a menu from a developer&#39;s point of view, or the role of menu is for those desktop applications and the, in fact, screen readers switch to a different mode. So you, if you decide to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use menu as a sort of technical role for your menu. You&#39;ve got a whole bunch of responsibilities that go with that. &#39;cause the screen reader has a certain expectation. So fascinating. But then if you go and look at something like the Nielsen Norman Group, I think I&#39;ve got it right way this time. Norman Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&#39;ll go with that. Yeah, so they will use. They&#39;re talking about patterns, usability, and how things will function for those. So they use the term menu bar for this constantly visible, section that&#39;s on, on your top of your page that navigates people and the navigation is things that might come off that, So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I just read the sentence that&#39;s written on the page in front of you there? Yeah. Just to show how interchangeable and weird the terms are, a type of navigate. So it&#39;s under the subheading of N navigation bar. It says a type of navigation menu implemented as a menu bar, hosting navigation categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they&#39;ve they&#39;ve used navigation twice. They&#39;ve used menu twice. And it is very hard to understand. In my head, I&#39;ve just decided, and this could be completely wrong, that menu is a, noun, and navigation is a verb. So the menu is the object, and navigation is the thing. The thing that you are doing, you are navigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via the menu. That&#39;s where I&#39;ve landed. I dunno if that&#39;s gonna work or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; The, probably with NAV as well, of course. It&#39;s a, sort of technical role. It&#39;s a landmark in accessibility, so it stands for something itself. So it&#39;s not so much a verb in that sense. anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but yeah. But, if you think about it, if you go to a restaurant, you are never gonna say, can I have the navigation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are gonna say, can I have the menu? Which if you like, then is a series of links, for want of a better word, things that you can get to, in other words, a plate of food arrives at your, table. but you. Navigation is what you do when you receive the menu. You navigate around and your finger decides, oh, I&#39;m gonna go look at this one for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I like the look at this. and so the navigation is the, doing the menu is the thing that you, hold. And like I said, I don&#39;t know that&#39;s gonna hold water. There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanna go off onto a tangent. There&#39;s a, yeah, sorry. Absolute. No, But with menus, there&#39;s a thing that&#39;s annoying me about menus when you go into restaurants right now, I dunno if this is happening in the uk, it&#39;s happening in India quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go in and you ask for the menu and they don&#39;t give you that. You have to get your smartphone out. Oh yeah. And you have to, and then you have to navigate through. Yeah. So yeah. Anyway, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Honestly, I could go on &#39;cause the whole 10 minutes would disappear. okay. So where are we at there? So you&#39;ve done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. and you, there&#39;s just a little paragraph, which I don&#39;t know, got explored. A menu to a developer has a specific role. Yeah. To a UX person. It may define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Pattern. Pattern. Yeah. So it&#39;s just what I was talking about then and I was just putting them up for those who can see where they are. Define there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Anyway, so we can use these words interchangeably. There&#39;s a lot of those that come up. Should we talk about the types of navigation we&#39;ve got? And this is why I think they&#39;re so bloody awful and confusing. I think we&#39;ve known this forever. I think the Norman Ling group way back probably in the two thousands talked about how dropdowns were terrible usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we have the main link navigation or menu bars. We know it. These kind of things that we expect to see often on the top right of a desktop application where we&#39;ll see home about contact services, et cetera. That main navigation. Then we have navigation now that&#39;s being activated by the hamburger icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&#39;s everything is hidden behind the Yeah, but this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is becoming really common. I think even on desktop. It&#39;s just the normal. Visual queue is, where&#39;s the three lines? Okay. That&#39;s where all of the site navigation is happening inside of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And there&#39;s a point to make on that. I&#39;ve listed it there on the hamburger, so Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;re getting that, but you typically find those on the mobiles anyway, to save space on those. we&#39;ve got breadcrumbs of course. Which is a sort of sub menu. But then when we get to dropdowns, Terminology again, gets, drop as two separate words with a hyphen between it or to join together for one thing, but also we&#39;ve got other terms for this, but drop down on hover, which which is a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can do that with CSS can&#39;t, you can actually hover over Oh yeah. That&#39;s quite common. Yeah, it is quite common. But it&#39;s also terrible because keyboard users are completely lost. They can&#39;t use it any longer. They can&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Access it. Yeah. So it&#39;s not accessible. And then we&#39;ve got, so the dropdowns on click, which is obviously the better thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropdowns on hover is often there, but creates all sorts of usability issues anyway. Which we&#39;ll move on to. Dropdowns on click and hover. So both will operate. We&#39;ve got adjacent icons, concealing a dropdown to a sub menu of a main item, which can be confusing, which also can be activated by the main item on hover or click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got. All these possible combinations of things about how that could use, how it could work, even though it looks the same to the user. then we have of course the nested or multi-level dropdowns, which I think are dying away now because of mobile, difficulties with that one, where they used to fly out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; seem to be more in like the, dropdown, something akin to accordions, don&#39;t we? So things are nested beneath other things, especially on mobile. It&#39;s just one thing under another. It doesn&#39;t fly out in a separate, yeah, slightly. I don&#39;t know. Floated right? A little bit. That&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be happening quite as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, no, we used to say a lot of that. And then we got the mega menu, which was supposed to be, oh boy. Solution to all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Mega menus can be like an entire website. Fully take over the entire viewport where Yes. And in a sense you just think, what do I do with that? Just so many choices. And how would you navigate through that with, with the tab key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally don&#39;t know so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. again, if you go down the route of, a proper application and use menu, you can use Arrow key. So it is potentially possible to do it, but a lot of work with JavaScript, yeah, so we&#39;ve got that and terminology, haunts us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again here, Hayden Pickin points out in, oh, I forgot what it was. I think it&#39;s accessible components, a sort of a book of his, that dropdowns is the behavior we&#39;ll get with HDL Select and options, so that&#39;s really where that term&#39;s used. And so some people also refer to &#39;em as pull downs. Yeah, it&#39;s an older term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if we go to the W three C&#39;S web accessibility initiative, they refer to them as. Flyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you see, that&#39;s fascinating. That one I&#39;d never even heard. I probably have some vestige of a decade or more ago, but it&#39;s a long time since I&#39;ve seen anybody talking about flyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. And that&#39;s, I&#39;m just for those There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyout leads, these are flyouts according to them. So we have a terminology issue again there. We really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do. Yeah. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I wanted to list those just because I think, I dunno if you, so I do, I found the, I when I, I. Die a little inside when I see a dropdown menu, even a hamburger on a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that my options are hidden and I have to hit this thing, which I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen with it or might drop down too far. I hate that I&#39;m not on the mobile phone much, but even on the desktop, I really hate the fact that I don&#39;t know if this top link I&#39;m on is clickable or whether it is a button to open up a menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s got an icon next to it, whether, unless that animates, whether that&#39;s the place with the Submenu or what I&#39;ve just hovered over it is the submenu. I actually get confused myself. Yeah. And I know how these all work. Yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you&#39;ve taken a really interesting approach with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Website, the no script show one where you&#39;ve essentially decided that all the menus are just gonna be in the footer, for want of a better word. And yeah, you jump link to that. If you click what might have been considered, I don&#39;t know, the, menu that flies in from the side on a mobile, you&#39;ve just jumped right into the footer In a, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a much more accessible way. I like that. That&#39;s good. go. If you&#39;re listening to this or watch it, it go and check it out. It&#39;s cool. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; in part two we&#39;ll just discuss it &#39;cause okay, yeah, of course. Yeah. I&#39;ll just discuss the markup on it. So we&#39;ll do that. okay, so let&#39;s have a look. We will talk about the code needed, &#39;cause we did that before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last one, when we&#39;re talking about accordions, that&#39;s needed for navigation. So straightforward. So HTML is gonna give us. All that we need in terms of semantics and accessible name. So we have the nav element, which is a landmark, and then if we put our A tags in a ordered or unordered list, then we&#39;re pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s gonna work. Yeah. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; more or less all you need in air quotes. Yeah. Nav followed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; by a list of As. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And for accessibility, screen reader is going to read out, the number of items. So it&#39;s quite helpful there. if we add in Aria, then we&#39;ve got a, more accessible way of being able to add more navigation components to our pages because we can label those up as, main navigation, secondary navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anybody who wants a, an overview of the page, the table of contents to get around, they&#39;ll be able to see that. And also with Aria, we can tell the user who&#39;s using the screen reader, which is the current page that they&#39;re on. Yep. Yep, So, that improves it. And obviously with CSS then we can have, beautiful horizontal rather than the standard sort of, vertical lineup that you would get with just HTML and where we can also indicate current page as well with that, by putting an underline when you&#39;re on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if we add in JavaScript, then that allows us to create interactive show and hide, which is. Generally that term, which we used last time as disclosure widgets, something where it&#39;s hidden is that sort of technical term, but that&#39;s where we introduce all these many different ways to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So can I ask a question at this point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got four things which increase? So number one is a given. So this nav with a list of As Yeah, that&#39;s the, basics. Then we&#39;ve got, we add in area for making it more readable. Yeah. CSS comes in and then JavaScript. So there are four things that we can do. Which of those are you, are you attempting to use for, in most cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are you, I&#39;m guessing you are gonna stop at the third one, the CSS one and ignore the JavaScript one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Okay. That&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking if I can, or the, conclusion I&#39;ve come to this, if I can get away with not using JavaScript, I save myself a lot of potential usability if I can get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With being able to show the, content in the correct order, then we get away from all of the difficulties that come with show and hide, I think. And, when you say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; sorry, when you say get away with what, is that a client coming to you with a particular feature or that they&#39;ve described that they want something which only really JavaScript could handle, so show hide for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you know what, or is it driven by more your own head? oh, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if, because I had a feeling that you would always stop at the CSS points. You would never stray into the JavaScript point ever basically these days. But maybe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you do. I have done, and I&#39;ll show that. Okay. Actually, in the second part, I&#39;ll show you where I mimicked with dialogue a, mega menu, which I did for a client, which I thought was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. But, I&#39;ll talk about that later. but yeah, it&#39;s interesting because I did have a cl I have had a client and it was. Probably the most difficult project that went on for just years and years, who had a very specific idea about how things should open up on this menu. And I had to get somebody in who knew JavaScript to do what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And effectively, I took myself out the equation and let them talk to the, and they were so upset because of course they, they hadn&#39;t been able to explain. Two, the JavaScript person gave &#39;em exactly what they asked for, but they hadn&#39;t worked out that, oh no, this is supposed to close when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. But on top of that, what they didn&#39;t know about that was the fact that, and I wasn&#39;t so aware as I am now, is that of course they hadn&#39;t thought about the usability for keyboard users. For screen readers, for any of those things. So yeah, generally I will avoid, Java, no script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it&#39;s a bit of a giveaway, isn&#39;t it, that we try to avoid. Yeah, yeah. I already mentioned the little subnote here that we can hover with CSS &#39;cause by saying that we can show in hide, we can do it with CSS, but keyboard users can&#39;t use that. So it&#39;s not, accessible and it&#39;s difficult as well on touch devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re on a mobile, it doesn&#39;t necessarily always work if you use hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so now a slew of four different problems that we can have in terms of, navigation. So UX design, SEO, accessibility. Let&#39;s start with ux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Gosh, yes. So ux. I think the, points I&#39;ve put here and the menu bars often look similar, but behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s my experience with going to, home about, I don&#39;t know if something&#39;s gonna drop down, how it&#39;s going to drop down. Yeah. Whether I click on the top thing or the sub menus, blah, blah. Confusing. we can&#39;t click on things we cannot see, which I think is one of the biggest faults of hide and show with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that, If, I don&#39;t know, there were some dropdown stuff there visually. I&#39;m not going to go to it, so I&#39;m gonna miss those pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So this is, where mega menus come in because they show all the things, but equally they then give us a bit of overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; presume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it as, as long as, there&#39;s a mega menu there, so if it&#39;s combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Okay. As often is, do you know it&#39;s, so you can easy, if it&#39;s not there in front of you, you&#39;re not gonna click on it. So I think that&#39;s a bit of a problem. Okay. e easy dropdown solutions make LOP sloppy. Site architecture easy too. And that&#39;s from my own experience of working with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because working with WordPress, it makes it so easy for you to have the sort of menus that you want with various dropdowns. But of course, working with other people who don&#39;t want to do the thinking about how things are laid out, they can just drop anything wherever they like. And that&#39;s solved. Its up in the menu somewhere, so you get all sorts of bizarre stuff going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some really confusing stuff goes on with menu. Sometimes what&#39;s in a dropdown is not what you expect,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And it&#39;s also very, that the interface of WordPress makes it just trivially easy to drop in possibly. Yeah. Too much. Or nest things within nested things. And before you know it, you&#39;ve got this collapsing menu of nine different layers and on the back end it, that&#39;s just offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not use it? There&#39;s no, no hint that&#39;s weird on the front end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. We need to really indicate that our links are what they are and what they do. If they go to an external site, there should be some clue. There&#39;s usually a, visual thing, which I&#39;ll show in part two. Yeah, that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; very, I, you tend to see that on obsessively H-T-M-L-C-S-S focused websites, Yeah. But, not much elsewhere. Yeah. if you really don&#39;t see that being deployed broadly across the internet, an external link is just, it&#39;s guesswork. If I click this, what&#39;s gonna happen? No idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; luckily screen readers will largely announce for them, but it&#39;s for your sighted readers and PDFs as well, and uhhuh, other things that people put in their menus, they should indicate what you are gonna get when you click on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s so annoying if you click on something you think you&#39;re going to ion within the site and you are downloading a PDF before you and you&#39;re in some sort of silo that you yeah. drop down on hovers can interrupt a user&#39;s journey to another target. So often, there&#39;s some articles about this and you just think, again, this is a complication when you&#39;re hiding and showing in, you are heading off to one part of your menu, but you touch the other part of it and it opens up instantly if it&#39;s an instant hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the solution that people invent, and this is where you think things are getting complicated, they think, let&#39;s delay this. That&#39;s at a half, half a second delay here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yes. I, can&#39;t remember the name of the website, but that this has happened to me on multiple occasions and it&#39;s profoundly annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because in some situ, I really can&#39;t remember, but there, I have had a situation where I literally couldn&#39;t overcome that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; In that I was on a device of sufficient width that my mouse could not get to where it needed to go unless I took this very precise kinda one pixel route around things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. Yeah. And, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just some confection of the, width of my device that I was using and the, the way that I was currently located. Yeah. This is, and again, you&#39;re solving it with a weird JavaScript based time function. Just let&#39;s add half a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;ll fix it. yeah, it will, but maybe there&#39;s an underlying problem there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well. Yeah. And, not, when you think about it, you, a lot of the reason you want this to be available there is because it, people don&#39;t like to click onto a new page &#39;cause they have to wait for it to load. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause of all the JavaScript you put in your menu. But, these days, I think, we can get faster loading sites, so why not just go to flipping new page if you, have to delay someone&#39;s hover, it&#39;s you think we just lost the plot a bit with this, I&#39;m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; guessing from all of this that you don&#39;t do not like hover, you want click in all the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right? That&#39;s what I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; do. Yeah. Okay. and I was very, I, do this practical accessibility course with, Sarah Erda, which I&#39;ll mention &#39;cause there&#39;s some of our examples I going to use there. And she&#39;s another one who hates, what she says she advises against any hovering, but of course it&#39;s common, hover and click give everybody everything Anyway, so that&#39;s one problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;ve got so many here. The hide and show, can also should not obscure important information that people, I, it&#39;s one of the, it&#39;s one of the rules actually that come with accessibility is that you&#39;re not to obscure. And that&#39;s quite difficult to do that with a lot of the menus that we have that pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&#39;t really, it&#39;s, I think it&#39;s a violation of wagg if you have what you commonly see as one of those navigations that pop up and take over the whole screen. I think it is, I think that&#39;s a violation of, okay. Oh, So becoming important because this week is one, this is the where, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where accessibility laws coming in. So we&#39;ve got that. disclosure, widgets have an interaction cost. Of course, if you&#39;re hiding and you&#39;re showing something, somebody has to go and click on it. it&#39;s extra work for them to do and that annoys me. If you don&#39;t need to, when you go to mobile and you don&#39;t need to click on something, you shouldn&#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s almost standard to force you to click. And that dear listener, was only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the UX bit got three sections to come. They get progressively smaller. This is just me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; ranting, isn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it? Yeah, no, it&#39;s great. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so design issues now. there is a good article there, which I won&#39;t go to, which is, really my sentiment about, this, that it&#39;s feeling like a tire design pattern now drop down menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it&#39;s, I didn&#39;t, did I mention this earlier, in this chat, or did it, was it before we recorded? But I was saying that I think, in a way that we copied. Print to our detriment. We&#39;ve copied, if you like, the menus that are in programs to our detriment when it comes to designing navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We definitely didn&#39;t add that in, to this. Yeah. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we did talk about it prior to hitting record. Yeah. And that&#39;s, think you&#39;re right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I&#39;ve come to with this. And I think a lot of people, if you look a lot, modern designs are avoiding that. But, so much dropdowns anyway. So I think it&#39;s probably something where we have no idea how the web&#39;s supposed to look, and we&#39;re creating it as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we copy print in terms of our design, and I think we&#39;ve also copied in terms of menus, preexisting desktop programs and applications as a way of dealing with menus. And I think, we&#39;re starting to move away a bit from that. But there are some, head turn in examples, which we talked about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of &#39;em, which is so copied, is Stripe. Oh. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the menus in particular, I think it&#39;s the product one. You hover, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:56] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Look at that. for those people who can&#39;t see, there were just so many options. they are subcategorized, and again, you&#39;ve got this issue. If you&#39;re on your way to something, you&#39;ve got interruption because I&#39;m a hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s that. But honestly, is this the best way? it is wonderful. Technically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; brilliant. Oh, beautiful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementation, like absolutely majestically gorgeous to look at. But yeah, there&#39;s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m a, Stripe user and I have no idea where to find what I&#39;d be interested in here. I just want to know what I mainly use it for ticking money off people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just gimme a link and a page that does that. No, what&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; curious there is they don&#39;t have a search feature embedded No. In their header, which is often the case, isn&#39;t it often these days you&#39;ll find search in the main navigation area, if not necessarily in the main navigation. Yeah. But they&#39;ve relegated search either to that menu, so hopefully they&#39;ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;ve given you enough to navigate to it, or maybe they&#39;ve just off offloaded that task to Google. They&#39;re hoping that you will choose the right set of keywords, which will deep link to whichever page you actually need from Google as opposed to doing it themselves. you can see what their intention, they&#39;re clearly trying to make it really so that you can get to wherever you want to go in, in one amazing menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is a lot to take in, isn&#39;t it? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and it I don&#39;t really understand the icons and the fact that they changed their styling from one to the other, I find a bit confusing. Anyway. One of the things that I did notice on this, &#39;cause the first thing I did see is this progressively enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your JavaScript fails to load for this, the only thing you can get to is the pricing. Interesting. So there&#39;s not a lot in terms of progressive enhancement there. There&#39;s none. No. If the JavaScript fails, you&#39;ve no menu other than the ability to pay for something because it&#39;s the only one which does not have a, some sort of hover state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. there&#39;s that. So I think I&#39;ve just twitched on one of my other points there. Design. da Let&#39;s have a look. yeah, my thoughts are, and this is where I can just maybe just show for those who are on YouTube, what we&#39;re doing, but I&#39;ll, oh, you&#39;ve done such a good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; job with this, I noticed this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so nice. it&#39;s actually view transition. Yeah. Actually I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t jump onto this yet. View transitions I think is really interesting because I think it&#39;s allowing us to, it&#39;s the, API that Yeah. Is supported now in safari. So I think it&#39;s about 87% support for view transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s definitely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the way it&#39;s gonna be done. It&#39;s so graceful. It looks so nice. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. And people are making like, carousel, not carousels, galleries and stuff where you&#39;re going from one page to the other. And one thing I never noticed until this, is that I was thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entirely different topic of tabs, but I was looking at YouTube and I thought when they have their tabs on YouTube that these were actually tabs, but I noticed that they take you to a different page. They take you to a different URL. So I think, yeah, I was surprised. Yeah, I looked at the, I don&#39;t realize that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh. no. You think it&#39;s tabs, but actually the pattern is tabs. But actually you are changing your URL, and I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to move a little bit towards, I think, instead of. And particularly if combined with speculative loading, which again is new and experimental, but that allows you, it allows you in the, sort of moderate form to say if someone hovers over this link here, it will start to pre-render the page or preload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose Yes, which way you want to go. Yeah, exactly. Yes. and you could just do that for two pages so it&#39;s not overwhelming your servers. So, I think, but isn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it interesting how profoundly un jarring it is. So it, so I should probably explain. View transitions combined with speculative loading view transitions enables you to let&#39;s go with the example of fade from one page to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of this hard reload where everything for a brief moment just goes, boom, it&#39;s gonna be, I can show you this. Yeah. Let&#39;s see. An action. So if you click on that, it may be this, the way that we&#39;re capturing the video for this recording, it won&#39;t, work so well because we&#39;ll probably have a sort of fairly poor frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you actually go to what David&#39;s looking at, and click around, there&#39;s this fade between, there you go. That was a lovely example. And combine that with speculative loading. I know it&#39;s nothing because really all that you&#39;re doing is, happening in the blink of an eye, but it, there is something far more aesthetically pleasing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just something Yeah. Like it&#39;s required now. I feel that&#39;s how it ought to be. &#39;cause it just feels, look at that. It&#39;s just so nice. Honestly, we&#39;re really getting in the weeds there, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But I think menus might be able to go that way. I think, if you&#39;ve got a big section of stuff like the services, a transition that&#39;s beautiful into a new page, I think, now that you can perhaps with speculative loading, make that page load so instantaneous that, and you can glide between it in an app-like way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. I think that&#39;s gonna change a lot of things. let me find my notes. Yeah, back up. There you go. Just there. So yeah, so that&#39;s my thinking. That might be the way forward with design on this one and, oh yeah, on our menu. So let me just move that. so I&#39;ve just added onto this. So we&#39;ve got a few items we need to put in our menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for those people just listening to that. But we have a basic home. And then for our different types of content, we&#39;ve got chat, learn, build, and then we&#39;ve got a more, which I&#39;ve now put little icon on. And when you hover over it, slightly changes, but just to make sure, I&#39;m just going to reload. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m just going to reload and then hover down to that. And what I&#39;ve done is it is got a second menu in the footer there, but because there&#39;s stuff that isn&#39;t more navigation, I&#39;ve actually put on the target a bit of animated. So with CSS we can animate the target, the place you&#39;re going to. So I put a little box around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I dunno if you saw that. I could see that. That was fabulous. Yeah. Yeah. But if I go back and refresh this, oops. I&#39;ll just go back and refresh this. So it, the target is only showing when, you actually click. When I&#39;m on the more navigation, so it&#39;s, it looks normal, so I just think, I&#39;m not sure what else you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really. If you&#39;ve got all your menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there and you can, there you go. and you can imagine a scenario where somebody like Stripe has all of that information. I don&#39;t know, very deep down on the page, but you click on the menu item and it takes you to it, and it would be. I can imagine very smooth and interesting ways to do it, especially with the dreaded Java script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I like what you did there a lot. I thought that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so I, it&#39;s made me think that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll go with this, for as much as I can. there will, I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be circumstances I haven&#39;t thought about where that&#39;s just not gonna work. But I just think the combination of, I fear before was making it ever present because page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think we can make them quicker and we can do nice effects to those pages. And then combined with this other idea of connecting to different navigation, so everything&#39;s present all the time, you&#39;ve not gotta worry about the next thing that we&#39;re talking about, SEO, which is the fact that JavaScript can possibly, we don&#39;t know Google say otherwise most of the time, but might create some search issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding something may mean that it&#39;s not found by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I guess really if, there&#39;s even a chance that it&#39;s not gonna be found, it&#39;s. Probably not worth it. It&#39;s like you said, if it&#39;s hidden, you can&#39;t click on it. If it&#39;s, yeah, not, if it&#39;s only visible with JavaScript who Google may not see it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; is it worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the SEO people do all these experiments and claim that things aren&#39;t quite, as Google might say, and Google also say, I think when they talk about anything that&#39;s hidden behind JavaScript, is that they will view that as secondary content. If you don&#39;t want it to be seen immediately, then that&#39;s their take on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;ve hidden it away for a reason. So it&#39;s secondary. So it will have less of importance according to what I&#39;ve heard them say. I&#39;m no expert on this. So to think about, and of course, Obviously important to SEO is getting lots of clicks. People going to different pages is a good thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we&#39;re gonna hide our content, that&#39;s gonna lead to less clicks. Also, if we&#39;re making them just find those links rather than go to them quickly. slowing down our number of clicks, obviously. So I think there&#39;s some SEO. Okay. Considerations, accessibility. Last one. Yes. it&#39;s straightforward until we get to disclosure widgets showing and hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it just goes beyond my abilities and I think most to I. Get the JavaScript right for this. But most checkers, accessibility checkers, they can&#39;t because they&#39;re not working interactively. They can&#39;t pick up on the now failures that most sites, to be honest. I started looking at sites now with a new view and pretty much every navigation I came across was bloody awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it&#39;s really big names. I, know you know about this because you&#39;ve got Yeah. Joe Dolson, haven&#39;t you? Yeah. That&#39;s his name. And you&#39;ve been doing series That&#39;s right. Yeah. With him. and he is been looking at menu, so yes. that&#39;s it. So there is one thing that I thought was interesting &#39;cause we talked about it last time with accordions, is the fact this new ability with details and summary, HTM l to be able to let that do the JavaScript work for us as disclosing, but it technically, it is possible to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it be accessible. The problem is with it is how various screen readers and their combinations with various browsers decide to announce it. So they won&#39;t announce the disclosure triangle. They will say that it&#39;s a, what it is, that it&#39;s details and some just to wanna mean it. Oh, yeah. So it, it&#39;s not ideal at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I see a lot of accessibility experts testing it out all the time to see if that might be an option for the future. So if we wanna drop down maybe details in summary, maybe the way, but at the moment it seems like a, bad idea. and, Yeah, as I covered before, I think if we use the role of menu, which a lot of people do, there&#39;s we have to add in the support for using space Escape Arrow, all things that we don&#39;t get when we&#39;re just with our links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s generally, I think 99% of the time, I think usability experts will say, don&#39;t bother there unless you&#39;re building a desktop app. Don&#39;t get into that. But there is a great example if I just brought this up, lemme just, yeah, that it, the, third tab along was the one that, yeah, loaded. I got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is this accessible menu which is on accessible dash, mega dash menu at Netlify app. I don&#39;t know the people behind it, but they have done all this where you&#39;ve got all their shifts, tab space, enter escapes home, and then all of these keys will work on there. Quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Menu here. And yeah, I looked at that and honestly I couldn&#39;t have differentiated it from the Stripe one visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously they haven&#39;t leaned into all the icons and the border radius and the, all of that. But it&#39;s got, it&#39;s all there, right? Every single thing is there. But I, did wonder how much, of a tax in terms of time, this was probably rather a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. And, also, you go this route, I mean I wouldn&#39;t be using it if I just borrowed it and tried to use it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s using in tailwinds something that wouldn&#39;t want does CSS but also even even though this is perfect, it may have some things that will confuse people. So people often when you get an open up here, they might be expecting, &#39;cause they dunno what mode they&#39;ve gone into after to have closed. So effectively they screen readers will have gone into a sort of desktop menu type Reading of it. So maybe it&#39;s not such an issue, but for those who are not, you might expect to see a close because you&#39;re not expecting, you can now use your keyboard to get outta this. Interesting, okay. So there&#39;s a legacy problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there that&#39;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. it still can confuse some users. Yeah, Which, however perfect this might be. and difficult to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it. I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&#39;s, so essentially what you&#39;re saying, David, is there&#39;s no right way of doing any of this. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. so conclusion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Conclusion is, I&#39;ve, given it, no surprise for our show that I think wherever possible we shout that I&#39;ve written here, should, avoid scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, if we can get away with our navigation with simple HTML and CSS, it makes life a lot easier. I dunno if that&#39;s always possible, but we&#39;re definitely gonna try for that. No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. who would&#39;ve thought a, show called the No Script Show? Who would&#39;ve thought they&#39;d avoid using a script? but you&#39;ve also made a couple of links there to, the Web Accessibility Cookbook, which is available as a, I guess Kindle, but as well as, a regular paper book in many, different formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also the, course that you&#39;ve been talking about recently, rather a lot actually. The Practical Accessibility course. Yeah. Some links, over at no script show slash 21 just navigate to the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and there they all are. We&#39;ll talk about this &#39;cause I&#39;ll show some of the examples when we go to our YouTube section, but I think probably for the audio we&#39;re done, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. In that case, I will bid you farewell and we will see you very soon for the sort of code example session. So thanks David. That was fascinating. Yeah, enjoyed it. Thanks. Bye bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accordions-with-js&quot;&gt;Accordions with JS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowed from Sara Soueidan’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://practical-accessibility.today/&quot;&gt;Practical Accessibility&lt;/a&gt; course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical approach using &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/yyLQmQZ/26d304b2094c87136a61a0b7cf12de18&quot;&gt;HTML buttons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accordion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/raNoXWr/b84fe6faa8823d00347532f428677044&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;interactive headings&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (progressive enhancement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-page search issues may be solved with the new hidden=until-found attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclosure-widget&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/disclosure-widget/&quot;&gt;Disclosure widget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With details the browser has a built-in shadow DOM component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;details-content has browser styles set to content-visibility: hidden which changes to block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styling the marker is &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/using-styling-the-details-element/#aa-style-the-marker&quot;&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exclusive-css-accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/css-exclusive-accordion/&quot;&gt;Exclusive CSS accordion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &#39;open&amp;quot; to keep any panel open.&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details open&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a matching name attribute we get an exclusive accordion. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details name=&amp;quot;anyname&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can fix the height and allow scroll (Adrian Roselli’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/aardrian/pen/gOqdaXQ&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our example I have borrowed the mock icon from &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/learn/html/details/#toggling_the_summary_marker&quot;&gt;web.dev.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In page search works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This video is a follow up to our podcast episode on website accordions. If you want to find that, you can at no script show slash 20. Here though, we&#39;re looking at some example accordions and their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the links for these are going to be at no script show slash learn. Forward slash 12. So I should say the 20 in the previous URL was the digits two zero and the 12 in this URL are the digits one zero. So no script show slash learn slash one two. There you go. Hello, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. Yeah. So yes, we&#39;re putting all the links that go to our code on this one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve just got things we discussed because if you listen to the audio, one, we have a little site where we&#39;ve got our little code snippets so people can use them and their own projects is they want, which we&#39;ll try to. Prick, this library of them. So let me go back. this one should be a fairly quick one, really as we&#39;re going through the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, I will just say, &#39;cause I wanna give a shout out to Sarah Dan, I dunno if I ever say her name correctly. but I am a student doing her practical accessory and I will, I&#39;m gonna look at a bit of code that she&#39;s done, but she is, this is. Fabulous. If you want to get into accessibility, it&#39;s not cheap, but it, is really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she updates it and she&#39;s updated it to talk about accordions recently. So that&#39;s how we know end. So I just wanted to, if we were building in with JavaScript, which as we decided earlier when we were talking about it, we probably wouldn&#39;t use that and find other patterns. But if we did, she has a couple of great examples, which I&#39;ve included here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actually I didn&#39;t need to open here &#39;cause I&#39;ve got it over here. Where there is this typical, this is a code pen example that she set up here, which is I think how most of the accordions have often been done, where we are using a button. as the header to open up the content on this and JavaScript is then opening those up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she&#39;s done on this is one of the things that we discussed earlier is that she&#39;s got this, that the, it&#39;s progressively enhanced, meaning that, it&#39;s the CSS. if, sorry, if the JavaScript doesn&#39;t load, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;re going to get covered because these are all gonna be open by default. So that&#39;s one of examples and I&#39;ll just quickly mention another, because there is a situation where you might, as we talked about before, might want inter interactive headings as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want, because these are in buttons, they&#39;re not treated as headings. They are actually buttons with text in it. So if we want a header, she does have another example over here where she&#39;s doing exactly the same. So it&#39;s progressively enhanced, but the code is in a heading and we can make them what they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, this will work. So it&#39;s gonna show up on the table of contents for a site. So that&#39;s probably more useful, For a frequently asked questions. Yeah, and you want the headings to be there. There is an interesting thing though, as we mentioned on the sort of audio side of things, is the fact that you can&#39;t do in page search to find things with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a new thing, which you made me aware of, which I can just find in her code here. Little bit further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; up, I think go up, up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s a little bit further. We have something that says, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; now you can&#39;t find it, but it is roughly there. You can&#39;t find it there. You could probably do eight now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve gone too far. I&#39;m pretty sure. I&#39;m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; sure it&#39;s down. da duh. Oh, yes. There we are. So we have what&#39;s coming in. She&#39;s brought Hidden Until Found, which is a new property, which will allow something to remain hidden where you&#39;ve put that in to. hidden is in the HTML, which actually is the same as display none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then things can&#39;t be found. But you&#39;ve got hidden until found, which solves this problem of in page searches if you wanna go JavaScript route. So I just wanna say that, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re looking at mainly today. let&#39;s go back to our notes here. I&#39;ve set up these examples and I thought the best way to understand how to put an accordion together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using just HTML and CSS, which we&#39;re trying to do on this is, to look at the basic details and summary, which allow us to do that. Good. Yeah. And that is on its own, disclosure, which is, so I&#39;ve created one, and we&#39;re actually using this. If we look at our transcripts now, we&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve actually got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of thing going on with scrolling over here. Really nice. and we need to just quickly, so this is what you get out the box if you put in the code of details and summary. In fact, lemme, if I can show you this and we&#39;re having some problems with the browser for some reason why we&#39;re recording this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped working and started to complain. But if we look here, we&#39;ve got the details in our code. Yep. And we&#39;ve got our summary. But I believe, let&#39;s see what happens if I do this, if I delete this element. you see it&#39;s done what expected it actually. If you just use details and you forget to put the child in of summary, it will, or the browser will automatically still stick in the information, but it will give you the title of details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. that&#39;s a fairly decent attempt at. Yeah. Progressive enhancement I guess, if That&#39;s not, yeah. if you just forget, you get to do something. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; if your title is details, then you probably then you&#39;re fine. Need to bother. You don&#39;t. Yeah, you don&#39;t need, so it is got that little thing in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to do, and I&#39;ll need to refresh this again, I think too, just show this is important really what effectively, what the browser now has given us. Is a shadow dom component built in to the page so we don&#39;t have to bother with the JavaScript. And hopefully I can show this as it is. So there&#39;s no styling on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just the browser styling, creating the marker there. And as we can see here, it&#39;s seeing shadow root here, and this is where things failed when I go into the slot here. Yeah, snapped here. we get to see, what we need to see here is that in these slots we&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve given an. Id of details, dash summary on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is quite useful. We&#39;ve got, as we can see over here, we&#39;ve got the idea of that. We&#39;ve also got a pseudo element of details dash content, so we can style that kind of within our details. And we&#39;ve also got, which we have to build into our CSS. So we also have this content visibility hidden and display block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we&#39;re swapping, which we can&#39;t show &#39;cause it&#39;s just failed, I. When we are swapping from one position to the other, the JavaScript is going on there and it&#39;s swapping from that hidden to display block. Yep. As we need to do with JavaScript. So that gives us our basic element there so we can expand on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now adding in, a little bit of animation to that. So we&#39;re able to do this. And if I just go down to my code, actually let me step back one and quickly discuss this because it does look like I&#39;ve got some animation on my marker. It does. And we get a default marker and we can style this marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spec isn&#39;t, is a bit spotty. This is quite new at the moment. In theory, we should be able to replace this by using, marker to something else, but at the moment, we can only really style the color of it and the size of it. And know that&#39;s gonna work. you should be able to put in another bullet point list, but it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to recreate this, what I&#39;ve done and to put some animation on this &#39;cause we can&#39;t animate the marker, I&#39;ve actually just put it in here. my own SVG over here. Okay. Okay. Which is mimicking this. and then in that way on the CSS for this one, we can start it now. I&#39;m not going to, it&#39;s not on our site actually at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the default marker without the, this drop down. The reason being that the moment safari ignores the ability to hide the marker, we, can&#39;t do a marker display. None. And if I go down to the CSS on this. Somewhere down here. Have something on the marker there. On the marker there. Yep. So I&#39;ve given this its own label, I&#39;ve had to use content and then empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Empty on that one to get rid of it. Display. None wasn&#39;t working for me on this. Any version of that. And the problem is that, as I understand it at the moment far, is ignoring that. So it&#39;ll show the default marker. As well, but then I could rotate this. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, it&#39;s nice, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s it. The other thing I suppose to mention on here is that as I was trying to show before, we&#39;ve got this pseudo element of details dash content on here, and this is the thing that we can now take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the inside the. The details itself and animate this, and this is the really cool thing about this now, is that we can use, although it&#39;s only supported in chromium browsers, but will come that we can animate now we can do a transition from this content. So we&#39;ve got, let&#39;s just have a look on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I need to go up a little bit. you had transition behavior on the. Yeah, so we, here we are. We&#39;ve got the details, content. I need to go here. Got a block size of zero, so there&#39;s no height on the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. But when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we set it to open, open on the, yep. Yes. Then we can set it to a height, which I&#39;ve restricted at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I put block size of open, it would open to the full extent of the content. But what I&#39;ve done here is to. Restrict that. It&#39;s a little thing that I got from Adrian Rose who&#39;s a sort of usability expert, which thinks that&#39;s a lot easier sometimes just to, I really like it actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And the reason that I really like it is firstly, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it just, for something which is not extraordinarily long and you might want to dip into that content, that&#39;s perfect. But also the, invocation of the scroll bar, which in this case is stands in real great contrast to the background color. You&#39;ve got that purple scroll bar. It&#39;s so obvious that there&#39;s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. so it just works. I think that&#39;s a really nice way of doing it. Obviously, if it was like a whole essay that you were supposed to read from start to finish, perhaps not, you&#39;d just want the whole thing to open without the, in your case, REM of 15, the height, but that it works really well. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So you can set it on individuals if you like, because then you can you can just add in a class really and have it on which ones you want and which you don&#39;t. But I&#39;ve done this on our site, but because it&#39;s a progressive enhancement at the moment with, the stuff that you can do, it&#39;s not across all the browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I was to open this up and it was. Bigger than the content here in Firefox at the moment. It would just behave as you would expect. We wouldn&#39;t get the animation at the moment. And we just open up so the fact that it looks okay on arom browser there. It&#39;s great, but there is something to mention on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation that&#39;s opening up the panel is not possible unless somewhere we have, and we might as well put this in our reset. We have this interpolate size allow keywords, and this is limited at the moment, again to chromium, but should be, I think by the end of the year it should be available for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this allows us to style from a hidden content to an auto size. it, it couldn&#39;t be put into all browsers. We have to put it in ourself because it might break some other functionality that&#39;s already set up in CSS, I dunno the intricacies of that, but, effectively it&#39;s something we could put, I put it against the html, but I could just, put it against the whole, wherever you want to put it, but you might as well put it in your reset there &#39;cause it&#39;d be useful wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that&#39;s it really. That&#39;s how it&#39;s put together. So we were able to animate, The inside is a progressive enhancement at the moment, and the marker, as I showed was something which I&#39;ve actually put in line with an SVG, a simple one here. Yeah. Which again, because of this, by default we&#39;ve got black and white here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s quite useful when you&#39;ve got inline SVGs to be able to do that because then you can set, a fill color. So we can see this is actually slightly changing too. My fill colors because I can now do this via the CSS if I think somewhere down here. Yes. We should see, I&#39;ve put it to our branding fill color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. Yeah. So the SVG. Yeah. So it&#39;s going to adapt to those two colors I&#39;ve got in there. Okay. Anything I you think I missed on this? No, I think that&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that&#39;s really useful. just wanna clarify, this will be able to be found at no script show slash learn, and then the number slash the number 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that where all this code is gonna end up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And then to get to the ex no, the, They&#39;ll stay on the intrinsic framework, which is a separate site, but the links will be there. Perfect. so you can just go click on this and it&#39;ll take you to the right page, because I need the intrinsic framework because there&#39;ll be lots of examples for each episode that we do, got it. And it&#39;ll get too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I will, communicate with David and we&#39;ll make sure that all the links that need to go are in the show notes, be that on the podcast or be that on the, YouTube videos that come with this. Is there anything you wanted to show before we knock it on the head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, we&#39;ve still got the, we haven&#39;t got into the accordion bit yet. Of course we haven&#39;t. Apologies. No. Yeah. So we just need to, this is bringing them together. So we mentioned it in the audio that in order to it, for it to be accessible, we can&#39;t just dump a whole bunch of these different. Details and summaries together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can see it with styling if we have styled it, that they grouped together, but somebody who&#39;s on the screen reader can&#39;t. So it&#39;s pretty much building on the same thing here. We, we need to do something about that. And in this case, on the example that I&#39;m showing here, the first example here, I&#39;ve put this in a section of group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think there&#39;s a mistake in this. Let me just have a look at that. It doesn&#39;t actually matter, but I could use this as a diviv and give it a roll of group. Yep. And then I, a label of whatever group name I want, and then against the idea of group names, then I can put in that as hidden. That&#39;s using the H TM L version to hide it so you don&#39;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then whatever I need to save for the screen readers. Now, when it&#39;s in a group, when it&#39;s in a role of group, that actually should be a div there. So I think I&#39;ll change that. It won&#39;t be in the table of contents if we want it to show up in a table of content. So this would be good if you are accordion wanted to show, say in another section, and you don&#39;t want it to stand out as its own section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you would use the group role, but if we do want it to stand out as its own thing, then we&#39;ll put it in a section. Do exactly the same. Are we a label by? With whatever group label we want. Again, connecting this to a header with the idea of that group label. And then what I&#39;ve done here with CSS is I&#39;ve visually hidden this and there&#39;s a class, which I&#39;ll put down on the bottom here, how to hide this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a utility class that I use that hides it from cited, but still reads out to. Non-sighted people. What the lemme just see, go back there what the title is. So it&#39;d be group title, something saying this. I can demonstrate it. I&#39;m not on a Mac &#39;cause you get this automatically. But you can see, because I&#39;ve actually used this with a section, we can actually see that this group title that I&#39;m, is coming up under the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a screen reader Yep. Will be able to jump to it quickly. So you, again, we have to decide which one&#39;s the most appropriate one for where you&#39;re going to use this. so that&#39;s the key thing here. There are a couple of things here probably worth mentioning is that you just see on this group of different ones here, I&#39;ve, combined things, so I&#39;ve left this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you load the page as open, and if we take a look, it&#39;s pretty simple. We can decide which one&#39;s going to be open. Yep. By just actually putting it open by the details on here. Yep. And in order to make these work as a unit where one closes as the other&#39;s open as an exclusive. Exclusive, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Set up, what I&#39;ve done is given them a shared matching name, so for each of these details panels, we&#39;ve got the name, which I&#39;ve called any name at the moment, but it could be anything you want. And then that makes &#39;em work as a unit. One closes and the other opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, perfect. So if you add the name, and you make it the same across all of them, then they behave as one unit and will collapse ones that are no longer required, that are no longer in focus, if you like, that are open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. And I&#39;ve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; left this, normally I think I&#39;d have them all closed, but I&#39;ve put the first one as open by doing this, but this is exactly what changes in the browser with the interactivity it puts in open there for you. So I&#39;d probably leave that blank and have a more closed, let me just have a quick scout through this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS here. Make sure that I&#39;ve covered, in fact, I&#39;ll go back to my notes if you don&#39;t mind here. No, that&#39;s good. Yep. so I&#39;ve mentioned that opened. If you want to open, I&#39;ve mentioned that we will just add in any details of the name attribute that we want to put in there. scroll I&#39;ve mentioned. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mock icon. So we were talking about this earlier. You didn&#39;t like this pattern, did you? Much So I&#39;ve put it in as another example. So here we&#39;ve got another icon. But what&#39;s quite nice about this, and I&#39;ve stolen it from web dev and you&#39;ll see it in the CSS here, it&#39;s, we&#39;ve hidden the marker. Although it will reappear and there is a reason for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if an Apple user goes in there, they&#39;re probably likely to see the triangle as well as this. Okay? If I&#39;d have put the, as I did on the first example with the disclosure and replaced it with my own marker, I probably end up with two markers. And two markers, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Does that&#39;s only on Safari, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; think so. And it probably is fixed. Probably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; will get fixed at some point. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it may, be, by the time we put this out, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s just something that people have noticed. But, that on here, and I won&#39;t go into the details of it particularly, but basically we are just adding a board, a bottom to it, and an animation too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve removed the marker. And we floated it off over here. And essentially this is content zero with a border added to it, which then we rotate to show this. it&#39;s in web dev. I&#39;ve nicked that little icon. So it&#39;s a nice way of,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s interesting. Okay. yeah. So makes it like a, makes it look like a plus and a minus symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s, a nice little effect, but there&#39;s actually no icon used at all. So when you&#39;ve got color schemes, it&#39;s just gonna match. Whatever the color is in there. And that&#39;s included in the code there. But I don&#39;t think I can very well explain this one, but it should probably make sense when you look at this, when we&#39;re looking at the summary before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s setting this and there&#39;s our transform and it&#39;s moving and rotating from 90 degrees. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. When it opens, it rotates. Yeah. So yeah, so it&#39;s a, without an icon, we&#39;ve managed to get something that looks like an icon. But you are not a fan of that, do you? It doesn&#39;t feel instinctive to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; really, it&#39;s the position of it. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s, not really the, I quite like the icon. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s over to the right and the text, which is the indicator of what you want, is over to the left. So for me, I think combining the title, or in this case, the heading one, heading two, heading three, with that icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same location. Yeah. So in, in our case, if everything&#39;s floated left, that just feels like the right place to put it because if I&#39;m going to that, it&#39;s hard for me to work out. Okay. It&#39;s a heading, but where&#39;s, where is it? Oh, I see. There&#39;s a, there&#39;s an icon over on far on the right and your, viewpoint, there&#39;s quite constrained, what is that, 800 pixels or something along those lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. If it was full width, which I think it might be, it would be really easy, especially if you didn&#39;t have a background color. if there was nothing to visually indicate this is a whole row or a section I have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; put Yeah. Interesting. Because I have, when you hover over here, I have put a subtle dark in and actually Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do that, I see it. Yeah. That makes it a little bit more obvious. And you&#39;ve got the, hand, icon as well. It&#39;s all Oh yeah. Something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to mention that you do. Yes. &#39;cause it&#39;s, horrible. I actually think with the default, unless you put Yes, the. The cursor to pointer is that you have to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other thing I&#39;ve just mentioned that&#39;s in the CSS here &#39;cause I don&#39;t want to go into too much detail. People &#39;cause it, it&#39;s very likely to change. but I have used relative color here, which is getting about, I think about 97% support now at the moment to add the darkening. So whatever was the, The color that I&#39;m using the shade that I&#39;m using here. I&#39;ve darkened it with relative color, so I split up the channels and darkened it there and for the transition on how that comes in there. that&#39;s it really. Yes. The other point was, again, with this, with all of this, you need to make sure you&#39;ve got that interpolate size on there, and if you&#39;re hiding stuff, this is the stuff that you might want for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also another bit of code on here, which I won&#39;t demonstrate at the moment, but if you. With any of these boxes, if someone forces the color scheme or they&#39;re on windows and they use one of their themes that you use for high contrast, this will put an outline around it. So your, so they&#39;ll look like little boxes around your details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s nice. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s it. I think that&#39;s it. There&#39;s a lot. Yeah, so is there, I&#39;ll probably change the code as we go along. This would should, I&#39;ve put it as updated over here because where this intrinsic framework will be as I keep adding to it, there&#39;ll be content and we&#39;ll discuss it each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things change. And obviously I might change the CSS, but it&#39;ll be updated and it&#39;ll show the date here. So if anyone wants to use it for the projects, they might want to check out when it was last updated. But it might change from when we do the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, that&#39;s perfect. And, where would we be able to find this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the URL for Intrinsic framework? I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s on the intrinsic framework.here. No, is it.no here? 20 four.co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s, but don&#39;t worry, you just need to go to our learn on the No Script show and there&#39;ll always be links to an examples that are on this, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no script. Show slash learn slash the number 12 in ER rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and check that out. And that is the space to find it. If that&#39;s the case, shall we knock it on the head? That was brilliant. Learned all about new ways of, doing accordions, what they are, how they work. All in css, no JavaScript in site. I&#39;ve maybe a bit here and there, but, mostly no JavaScript in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, David. Yeah, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Website accordions: the good the bad and the ugly</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/20/" />
    <updated>2025-06-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/20/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-an-accordion&quot;&gt;What’s an accordion?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection of (hide and show) disclosure widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection &amp;quot;headings&amp;quot; with icons which when triggered reveal a panel of previously hidden content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; some articles point to other UX patterns. Here we are not considering overlays or anchor links to page content as accordions.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-accordions&quot;&gt;Types of accordions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive. This is when only one panel can be open at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non exclusive where the user can open how many they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive or non-exclusive with an open/close all toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-needed-for-accordions&quot;&gt;Code needed for accordions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently accordions always needed JS and ARIA tags (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Jan  2020 we got the details and summary elements that allowed us make non exclusive accordions with only HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Sept 2024 we could add matching name attributes to the details elements to allow us to create exclusive accordions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want a open/close all toggle we still needs Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/interpolate-size&quot;&gt;Interpolate-size&lt;/a&gt; allows us to animate the opening of an accordion panel. It is still experimental and limited to chromium browsers, but is a progressive enhancement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-we-might-use-them-ux&quot;&gt;When we might use them (UX)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A condensed version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-on-desktop/&quot;&gt;recent articles &lt;/a&gt; from the Nielsen Norman Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving Scannability (less clutter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces scrolling (quicker access to specific content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can make some content easier on mobile. (large articles or long forms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downsides&lt;/strong&gt; (depending on use and implementation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased Interaction Cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragmented Access to Information (can’t compare panel content easily).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty with printing, accessibility, SEO and in-page search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;small&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other articles:&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8I7rplPN8I&quot;&gt;Accordions: 5 Scenarios to Avoid Them&lt;/a&gt;   and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZjnqRsxzo&quot;&gt;Accordions on Mobile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility-considerations&quot;&gt;Accessibility  considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details and summary make things easier as the browser takes care of the interaction, state and role side of things, but to be accessible we can not just add a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need ARIA to tell the screen readers that these are grouped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if they need to be included in the page&#39;s table of contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if the accordion headings should be announced as regular headings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-considerations&quot;&gt;Design considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, we have more design control with JS, but more responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have a fallback for when JS does not load. Andy Bell lists 15 situations &lt;a href=&quot;https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available/&quot;&gt;where this can happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the design issues with using details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation is presently experimental or limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browsers marker icon has a limited styling option. We can remove it with content: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;; but Safari presently ignores that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detail and summary open up lots of possibilities. Bramus Van Damme has been doing some &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/styling-details&quot;&gt;cool experiments&lt;/a&gt;, but following Google accessible carousels that were less than accessible I think these may not yet be production ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seo-considerations&quot;&gt;SEO considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those using accordions dependent on JS might want to research beyond what Google says about being able to find hidden content, but as far as we know there are no issues with using details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonus with details and summary is that in-page search works and panels will open to show the highlighted text. (presently true for Chromium browsers but as part of interop it should be true for other before 2026).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordions are often used for FAQ pages. There&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt; for this, but probably only useful for bonafide health and government sites these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the no script show focussed doing the most with HTML  we would probably look to other patterns if JS was needed.  For example if there was a page with lots of content sections. We&#39;d probably follow what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; does by using anchor tags or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/partial-keyframes/&quot;&gt;Josh Comeau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/12/&quot;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first in our series looking at various components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re gonna be talking about accordions. The format for this series is that we&#39;ll first talk about the components in terms of when they may be helpful in the light of UX or not, but also we&#39;ll be looking at them in terms of accessibility and SEO considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll also talk about the code needed. But as this goes out as an audio podcast, we&#39;ll also follow this episode up with a part two. This will be video content that looks at some code snippets and working examples. And as always, the person actually doing the real work is David Waumsley. Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so hopefully this format will work. And I had this idea a long time ago, and I built this sort of site for my own use called the Intrinsic Framework. It&#39;s a bit of a joke name, I can&#39;t think what else to call it. Where I was collecting all these snippets I got from other people and, things that I might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we did our show builds, we did three of these builds. Basically, I used the same pile of snippets. So I thought what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll try and brand, that, that whole thing. To match with this so we can talk about stuff and then we can actually show some of these snippets as well that anyone can use if they wanna take away and use them or tell me where I&#39;ve got things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be helpful too. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;re gonna have two websites in effect. We&#39;re gonna have one with the content, like the stuff we talk about, the podcast, the videos, that kind of thing. But then also there&#39;ll be a, a. Different layer, the intrinsic framework layer where you can go and see how these examples work and find the code and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. So we, I mean we&#39;re, all putting it on the no script show. So we&#39;ve got, we, did it anyway. I did some solo videos, didn&#39;t I? Which we characterized as learn. There were short videos where we talked about code or I talked about code then on my own, but now I&#39;m gonna do it with you &#39;cause it&#39;s a lot more entertaining when I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, so we can actually bring up the show notes &#39;cause we have got some notes to talk around. Here we are. Okay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So this is gonna be available at no script show slash 20 if you want to get in touch with us. And today it&#39;s all accordions all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. The good, bad, and ugly. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t, it&#39;s a bit more like click bait, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it is. yeah. So we&#39;ve got notes. So first of all, I guess we ought to start with defining what an accordion is. So I&#39;ve got a couple of. Definitions, if you like, which I&#39;ve seen from various places. One is that it&#39;s a collection of hide and show disclosure widgets, which is generally a sort of W three C kind of term for these things, disclosure widgets, and then other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people like the Nielsen Norman Group. Or is it Norman Nielsen Group? I always forget. Anyway, yes, the UX people, I think they would refer to it as a collection of headings with icons that when triggered would reveal a panel of previously hidden content and. I&#39;ve put a little note on this one actually, because I looked through a few articles preparing for this and talking about, design of our accord, accordions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a lot of those when I went to the example sites, and it could be that the example sites had changed, but they weren&#39;t actually what we would think as accordions where something drops down below. They were sometimes overlays, they were sometimes, just anchor text, go into somewhere else on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so for, this, we&#39;re really thinking of accordions as those, know, drop down. Kind of things, little disclosure, which is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. can I tell you what I would&#39;ve said prior to reading your show notes here? I would&#39;ve just said, yeah, basically it&#39;s a bunch of horizontal titles. Really? Yeah. And you click on it and then something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peers, usually with some kind of transition, like a slide out or something like that. And you&#39;ve got this option to open and close. Sometimes you open multiple, close multiple, have one open at a time, those kind of things. But I guess it comes from the instrument, doesn&#39;t it? That you know the accordion, like a piano with a squeeze box in between the idea that it gets bigger and gets smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it, but it goes sideways word, isn&#39;t it? Yeah, definitely go sideways as opposed to up and down, but I&#39;m imagining that&#39;s where it comes from anyway. But, always to do with JavaScript. There&#39;s always an element of JavaScript in there because things have been hidden and they need to be revealed in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s, and that&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and that&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about Yeah. Because we can now do it with HTML and CSS and have it accessible, but, nice. But, next thing I&#39;ve got here is obviously the types of accordion that we have. &#39;cause they do have names. I didn&#39;t know this. So an exclusive accordion is when, I think this is typical expected behavior of accordion that when you open one with a trigger or the heading a panel, the other ones will close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you only keep one open at a time. So they work as a group, but there is the non-exclusive. accordion where you can open as many as you like. and then we have the kind of inclusive or non-inclusive where there is an open and close or toggle where you can just open them all up or close them all up if you want, which is quite handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s curious,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; ju just thinking about it, it&#39;s curious that this is something that&#39;s become a normal design pattern. Because I&#39;m imagining when the browsers first started implementing things in HDML, that probably this wasn&#39;t even on anybody&#39;s radar. And then some, yeah. Some ingenious person thought, gosh, there&#39;s too much here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any way of making it less, getting rid of half of the content that we&#39;ve got, but somehow discoverable by the user. Yeah. And and now it&#39;s just a completely normal, accepted part of. I&#39;d imagine if you go to many websites, a significant proportion of them will have something akin to this somewhere, maybe as an FFAQ or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, anyway, carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. just thinking back to the, websites that you did for clients before, do you, did you use an accordion a lot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; quite often actually. And usually it was on the things like the FAQ kind of page where the whole point was that you wanted to put a ton of information on there, but you also wanted to make it so that the headings were the thing, not the actual content, and then the person could discover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I always implemented it with a kind of drag and drop page builder style solution. I don&#39;t think I ever built one. Outside of A CMS. So I didn&#39;t explore how the HTML was structured and the importance of that. It was always just a, drop in a widget or an, a block or whatever you, might do in the WordPress space, and then fill out the, available containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;d have the title and then the, actual content. That was it. But there&#39;s way more to this, and obviously now that it&#39;s being done with just CSS, you&#39;ve gotta know what those bits are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I, same for me. Really? I don&#39;t think I used an accordion until I started using the page builder and then I overused them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now looking back, I can see I, it was there because you thought, oh, FAQ page. Yep. Of course I need an accordion. Here&#39;s one I can drag in. Yep. And it, yeah. Anyway, we&#39;ll, move on to that. Sorry I interrupted myself. No, that&#39;s okay. The code needed. Yes, that&#39;s what we&#39;re moving on. So this is the interesting thing really, is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really until recently, we always needed JavaScript and if we wanted them to be accessible, we would need to add Aria tags as well to those so screen readers can understand what&#39;s happening. But from January, 2020, we got the details and summary element that allowed us to make non-exclusive accordions effectively only with html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we don&#39;t even need the CSS, the browsers own, style sheets. We&#39;ll do what we want, That was great. From September last year, 2024, we could add matching name attributes to the details element that would allow them to work as one so we could create exclusive. So one would close as the other one would open as long as those names matched against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was a big move forward. And in terms of styling, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but just recently, and it&#39;s still limited at the moment we have, I always pause when I want to say this interpolate size, which is something which just come to CSS and what it does. is, I dunno if I can explain it well, but it, in that, the case of us, it allows us to be able to use CSS to size something that isn&#39;t seen that&#39;s hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when something is closed, if you like, you&#39;ve got nowhere of being able to do a transition to an open stage. And this will allow this to happen. Now, to be honest, we will get onto that when we get onto the CSS. It&#39;s a bit of code that you probably want to put in all your star sheets and your resets because they would&#39;ve just introduced this ability to do it, but it would impact on other CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have to add it in if you want this functionality, but it&#39;s one of these things that you probably likely to always want, so you would just stick it in your resets. but anyway, it does allow now for us to have a bit of animation when we open those tabs because. As it is. So suddenly we&#39;ve got something which is like the JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordions that we&#39;ve always known. There&#39;ve always been a little bit of animation there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just re just reprise that just to make sure I&#39;ve understood that. So prior to January, 2021, you needed JavaScript if you wanted to achieve anything akin to a, a ahy show state. Yes. Yes. So an accordion January, 2020, we got, details and summary, which allowed us to have a single element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could do multiple single elements, but they weren&#39;t in any way connected with one another. You would just have a detail and then the summary, and you click on the detail and the summary is open, but there&#39;s no animation. It just suddenly open, suddenly closed. Then in last year, that&#39;s surprising to me, September, 2024, you could now somehow bind them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could have multiple details, multiple summaries, and they would bind together so that you would open one and another would know that was open. So maybe another one should collapse. So all of a sudden. September, 2024, we&#39;ve got something which starts to feel a little bit more like the JavaScript accordions where they&#39;re interacting with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then finally, right now, interpolate, he said trying to get the word right size, is new. Maybe it&#39;s not widely accepted, but the idea there is it, can figure out that there&#39;s this zero sized thing Yes. And then expand it. And now we&#39;ve got the full range of things. It now feels like an entirely Java script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less accordion is available. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; There was no way to, to have the height goes from zero to, an auto size, which you would need to contain all of that stuff before this. And it&#39;s still not supported. it&#39;s only really on Therom browsers at the moment, but it will come to the rest. So I think we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guarantee that we&#39;ll be able to do this. Okay. There, there were, other ways, which I&#39;ll talk about later on that one. So let&#39;s, should we move on to Yeah. Why we might wanna use them? Sure. I&#39;ll bring up the article that I was looking at, which is from the, now it doesn&#39;t tell me whether it&#39;s Norman Nien, but the NNN group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&#39;s all helpful, isn&#39;t it? Yes. and there&#39;s some great examples on here. actually I&#39;ll go. I&#39;m distracting myself. I&#39;ll go back to, what we said were the main benefits. Can we just quickly go over this one? okay. What they list, and there&#39;s a few articles and I&#39;ve put links to them on the show notes here, but there&#39;s, the benefits is really improve scanability so there&#39;s less cut out on the page so that you&#39;ve mentioned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce. Scrolling, if you need to get to specific content so you can get there much quicker, and that it can make the content easier, particularly on mobiles when say you&#39;ve got long articles and you want different sections or the thing we were looking at earlier where we thought is useful, where there might be a step by step process that you go through, say with a form where you complete this bit and you want to open the next bit to complete the next bit, so there&#39;s not this big overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. The downsides which we&#39;ve got here, which will always depend on the use and implementation with this, is that there, there is for the user an increased interaction cost, so they have to keep clicking on stuff. there&#39;s fragmented access to information, so they can&#39;t compare. The content in, if they&#39;re gonna close, if it&#39;s exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. they can&#39;t compare what&#39;s in that, information. So that can get annoying. And then there&#39;s all the other difficulties that are there. most accordions out there when you look at them, don&#39;t function properly. but there are issues with being able to print out the content that&#39;s in an accordion, accessibility issues, which will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touch on data, and sometimes with SEO, with the, content is hidden and not easy to find, or not easy to find with an in-page search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. okay. So that would be a scenario where a, an accordion was collapsed. The dom shows that a certain string of words through search is somewhere on the page, but where the heck is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you, How do you locate it? Would you have to open that in order to click through the search to find it? Yeah. That&#39;s tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I&#39;ll bring up that article and apologies for those people listening to the audio only, but there&#39;s not much to see here. So there are a couple of quick examples, which I thought were, I&#39;ll just scroll down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These that they put in their article and I. The best use I, I think of is they show an example of the Logitech page where it&#39;s a typical product page where you&#39;ve got the main product on the left and on the right you&#39;ve got that thing where you&#39;ll add to cart and some basic details. But also there&#39;s a little dropdown of a, accordions there, where you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just get other information about the spec and details, compatibility, support and all that kind of stuff. But not everybody will want that to go to checkout. And if you were to put that in, that would be a lot of text. You wouldn&#39;t see the item you&#39;re going to buy. So I see this as a really good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s interesting because on some checkout pages, you see the sort of the sister of accordions, which is tabs. So that&#39;s a horizontal layout. Yes. a similar idea. But this works much better in a sidebar, doesn&#39;t it? You couldn&#39;t do a taped interface for that content. But, but an accordion here works really well and it&#39;s curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause I just, that example, I would use that, I would definitely be clicking on the specs and details. Yes. But I don&#39;t wanna see the compatibility, the support, the, in the bot. I don&#39;t wanna see any of that. So having it collapsed and me seeing the option to go into the tech spec, that&#39;s exactly the way that I would like to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s all just in the sidebar is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it solves that problem. And they say there&#39;s about sort of 10% of people who just need all the details. They can get the type of person who will investigate the footer in, for all the links and everything that, that type of person. And it&#39;s a way of bringing that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without, it makes it more available where it needs to be. So I can see the good use for interesting thing is though, on the Logitech, if you do go to that page now, I, imagine it&#39;s changed since they did this article, which is only a couple of years ago. But now if you actually go to that and you click on it, it doesn&#39;t open up a dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually. It does an overlay that comes in from, the right hand side. Oh, okay. Overall, yeah. yeah. oh, nevermind. Yeah, it&#39;s a good idea. Yeah. And the other example that they put here, which is from a site, which is Learn, HTML, where they use it to section up the sort of syllabus content that they might have there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might want to look at different things on the syllabus, and you can go into that. And that on a lot of articles as well, where there might just be. Not everything&#39;s gonna be of interest, and you want to. Just not overwhelm. so we have to scan down. So I could see that. So that&#39;s, there have got a couple of good uses, but I&#39;m guilty of, I&#39;m gonna scan down here to where I think the one that I&#39;m most guilty of doing is this one here on the Department of Revenue that they show where there&#39;s three accordions all closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you were to open those up as they show. Basically that&#39;s just a header and a normal, standard bit of text, which would just be a lot easier to scan through this, wouldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gi given the amount of text there, I suppose a decision has to be made about whether there&#39;s any utility in having an accordion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of those thoughts is how much there is. And there&#39;s really not a lot. And because there&#39;s not a lot, why not just get rid of the, the accordion in the first place? Less interactions. But obviously if each of those were, I don&#39;t know, twice, three times the length that it is there. Then it suddenly does become useful because you&#39;re avoiding the scroll and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, I think in that situation I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;re using some kind of CMS and the CMS will probably have a field where they can dump that information and that information will automatically end up in a, an accordion, if Yeah. As opposed to a page by page analysis of should this go on accordion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should it not? So maybe it&#39;s the CMS, which is making the decision for them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve certainly gone to loads and loads of, obviously I think page builder sites where there&#39;s frequently asked questions and then literally the answer is just a couple of words. Yeah. Do you offer a refund and you open it up and the word is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It&#39;s so frustrating to after that interaction cost, yeah. Is, really a lot of the problem. and you take on a lot of issues, responsibilities for. how these things are gonna work to be accessible to all. Okay, let&#39;s go back then. So accessibility considerations. yeah, so we, so details and summary makes it a lot easier now for us to be able to create an accessible I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordion, but, we can&#39;t just stick a whole bunch of them together and leave it there. We do need to tell screen readers that this is a collection of items, so we do need Aria to be able to let them know that it&#39;s grouped, which we&#39;ll get onto. when we do the more video bit, but we need to tell &#39;em how that is grouped as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we need to decide whether that content or the content that is going to be included, whether the accordion itself is going to be included in the summary of the page and is content. So for screen readers, they get a summary whether they&#39;ll get the headers. So we have to bake that into it. And then we also have to consider should those accordions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have their own headers as such. So we would expect when we look at frequently asked questions, a lot of the time that these are actually headers. But if we&#39;re using accordion a lot of the time with JavaScript, we would put that in a button. And it loses all its meaning as a header. It can&#39;t be a header and a button at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and the same happens if we use summary within details. It&#39;s mapped to the button role. So if you, can put a header in it and stylistically, I think it will adopt that, but it loses its meaning as a heading. So there are those sort of considerations. About the type of content that we have for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. There&#39;s actually a lot there isn&#39;t there? And, becoming from a background of using a CMS and page builders and things like that, obviously you are, maybe they have the options for these kind of things, but probably not. Maybe most people wouldn&#39;t explore them. Just the fact that it puts the accordion on the page, you kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that job&#39;s done. Yes. But there is a lot there. aria are able to say that things are grouped. So if you&#39;re using just a single detail, so summary and details, you&#39;re, better, that&#39;s fine. But when you start to group them together in this way that we were describing earlier, you need to in some way indicate that these are group, they, form part of a wider group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then whether or not things don&#39;t need to go in the table of contents and, Buttons as headings and headings as buttons is also problematic. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You, you&#39;re always gonna need to put it in either a diviv, and you can give it a roll of groups so somebody knows. But ideally you add r we a label buy and then put that to a title, which you may or may not want to hide for sighted users, or if you want it to show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table of contents, we have to put that then in a section and do a similar thing. So it&#39;s quite interesting, all this consideration. So yeah, I doubt there would be a page builder, one-off, accordion that could. Swap to all of those different things. So probably, they&#39;re always going to be used wrongly in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But, nice to know that given the knowledge, which will impart, there&#39;s an answer for each of those problems. The considerations that&#39;s the right word. there&#39;s a way of doing it correctly. So that&#39;s good to know. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Design considerations. we talk about that. That there&#39;s obviously more design control that you&#39;ve got if you&#39;re going for a JavaScript approach than you can because there&#39;s some limitations with details and summary using it as an accordion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because as mentioned, we&#39;ve got this, Animation, but it&#39;s still limited at the moment, so that&#39;s not gonna work for everybody. We&#39;ve also got, and this is really interesting, I&#39;ll get into it more with the code, but the, we have the marker that we get by default. This little triangle. Yeah. Which changes if we just use H two ML and use the browser zone user agent styles, we get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outta the box. But when you wanna change it, it becomes quite tricky. You could do some global changing of color, in theory on the documentation, at least with web dev. It says that you will be able to replace that like any other marker and use like a bullet point, any of those listed, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are some still little quirks with that because even if you remove by using content and put those in quotes with nothing in it to remove the marker against the marker, It gets removed so you can add something else in. But that&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem to work on Safari browsers at the moment, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are, at the moment there are design considerations, but I think, they probably still make it for me, they make it worth looking to not have to deal with JavaScript and how that might fail for people and all the other considerations. I still think, we can design. accordions just with details and summary quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Okay. we said we&#39;ll take everything by SEO. There&#39;s not much I can say on SEO. I did a bit of research, to see what was being said about this. And as far as I know, if we&#39;re using details and summary, which is great, is the fact that search engines will be able to find the content that&#39;s within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will also, and this is the big bonus which we won&#39;t get with the JavaScript solution, is that we get. in page search, it will open up the tabs to find the content within those by default, which you won&#39;t necessarily, which it&#39;s difficult to achieve actually with JavaScript. So there are some benefits, I think, and I think also, there are different reports out there because the, bottom line I think with Google is, don&#39;t worry about your hidden content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll find it, but other people do experiments and they say that might not be true under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just to clarify that, then, if you are just using a regular details and summary, then if you, embed content in there and somebody search is searching for that content, Google can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only that in the browser will automatically open that, summary area in order to reveal it when you do that search and then ultimately, tap to find it. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; If the search finds it, but also if you&#39;re just on your page and you&#39;re using, what controller f or whatever Yeah, exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It will open up the right tabs. I say that there is a caveat That will be the case by the end of this year. By 2006. It should be, at the moment it&#39;s just working in the chromium browsers, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;re running a bit ahead with that. that was it. There were the only other little thing I looked at that I thought was a SEO consideration &#39;cause it made me think about FAQs and there was a big thing wasn&#39;t there, about using schema markups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yeah, for these things and getting, yeah, I think this is my understanding. I&#39;d love to be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but reading what they say, I think it&#39;s really only something you&#39;d want to do for the sort of bonafide health organizations or government sites where they&#39;ve got frequently asked questions because they&#39;ve really downgraded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you know the user AI to find most of the stuff, and they&#39;re not interested unless you are, a big, legit company with some real, serious, frequently asked questions that are. gonna be, checked. yeah. So I don&#39;t think the whole marking up a schema, but effectively that would be its own thing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would just be, if you were still using schema, you would only be linking it to the IDs of your separate panels anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Okay. Alright, that&#39;s it. So that&#39;s an in conclusion then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I, think as our show is the no script show. our thing is to try and make websites as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where the reason why we&#39;re gathering these sort of snippets is that we can put together some more builds later as easily as possible for anyone can do it. as we&#39;re no good at scripting languages, we wanna avoid js and it just. So there are some situations where we need JavaScript. So if we want something where it&#39;s a toggle, as we said, where we want to open everything up or close it all in one go, we need JavaScript for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think under a circumstance like that and another circumstance where we might want a actual heading to be the trigger for our panel. For the meaning there. Under those circumstances, we need JavaScript, but I actually think I would for those kind of things, I would do something like Josh Komo does on his blog post where I&#39;d create my own little anchor tags that scroll down to the header for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So that&#39;s really useful if it&#39;s essentially you&#39;ve got a whole page kind of accordion there, haven&#39;t you? You, yes. Put something in a sidebar because it just makes it so much easier to get from point A to point B. but that really wouldn&#39;t work as an accordion &#39;cause you&#39;d be just hiding so much content and when you open one up, it would be just like this massive scroll to, to get to the other one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That&#39;s superior in that scenario, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so. I can&#39;t think of a situation. Maybe you can where I think the. Using details and summary to make a, an exclusive, accordion is something I will use where I need to save space in. Yep. Particularly with that Logitech thing. Yep. On the shopping I can say I use that, but for anything else where it needs JavaScript, I actually now think I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;d use a different pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I If you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think hiding content is its primary purpose, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s just taking something which you wish to be discoverable. But you don&#39;t wish for the person necessarily to see, so it&#39;s basically information which not everybody needs. So an FAQ is a great example of that. because if you are, if you, really genuinely don&#39;t need an answer to the 15 questions that you&#39;ve got on, they&#39;re just one of them, that&#39;s the one you wanna hone into, but you wanna be able to just summarize the titles quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it this question? No, click on this one. There&#39;s my answer, and then move on. But the example that you just gave from Josh Yeah. that wouldn&#39;t work. &#39;cause all of that whole page is supposed to be the content. You don&#39;t really wanna hide anything. Yeah, you just wanna navigate to it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And that&#39;s how, what Wikipedia do, they&#39;ve got. Yep. basically anchor tags that take you to where you need to go. And I think that&#39;s a good way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; of doing this. And you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; keep all your headers, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah. And you can deep link from elsewhere, can&#39;t you? Which is quite nice. Yeah. Yeah. just to be, just to help people navigate this, let&#39;s say people are getting to the end of this piece of audio content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s gonna be some associated. Like tutorials if you like. You&#39;re gonna do some run throughs of how you actually build all of this. Where will Thats surf surface on our website. Will it be available in a particular spot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. This one will come up &#39;cause it&#39;s following on from the learn videos I did. So what we&#39;re just gonna go and do now is, it will be available on the no Script show slash learn slash 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Got it. Okay, so they&#39;re not in sync. So 20. So this is the no script show, forward slash 20. It doesn&#39;t map. It&#39;s not go to Learn dash 20. So we&#39;re gonna be no script show Forward slash learn. And then obviously from forward slash Learn you be able to see things. But coincidentally, this one is gonna be forward slash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 at the end as well. Okay. Makes perfect sense. There&#39;s a, there&#39;s some little, there&#39;s some little teaser. Yes. So yeah, that&#39;s a really nice development that we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re doing these audio video pieces of content where you can see us discuss the problem if you like, and then we&#39;re gonna go pause the video and then make some other content, around how to actually build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s quite nice. New development for this whole. Whole enterprise. Are we done for today though? Yeah. So it&#39;s just buy to our audio. Okay. In that case, yeah. See you later. Audio listeners. for the rest of you, we will continue and crack on with our learn. I&#39;ll see you in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-david-thinks-he-got-wrong&quot;&gt;What David thinks he got wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not fully comprehending the nature of the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgetting the fundamentals (poor semantics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring the rule of least  power (too many dependencies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforcing systems on clients rather than around them (not being agile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling websites as various &amp;quot;products&amp;quot; (beyond my ability).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not taking payment upfront (early on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having an escape route (ability to pass clients on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-he-thinks-he-got-right-but-did-badly&quot;&gt;What he thinks he got  right, but did badly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a recurring income (but not protected).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting with face to face contact (but over complicating).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging all into the build process (but creating ways to mess it up).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-he-thinks-he-actually-got-right&quot;&gt;What he thinks he actually got right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not excluding low budget work or family and friends*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not specialising (frontend skills are general).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critically assessing to keep costs down (hosting mostly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Often advised against, but I also reject these:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Clients are not interested in the tools you use&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Clients are only interested in the value you bring&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;We are the expert - not them&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Clients without X budget are not serious&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &quot;wisdoms&quot; tend to come from &quot;business&quot; courses aimed at page builders users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Similar to online &quot;trader&quot; courses where motivational speakers sell dreams and secret formulas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-he-is-trying-to-solve-now&quot;&gt;What he is trying to solve now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better messaging (content first over &amp;quot;pretty pictures&amp;quot; of websites).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster building with snippets. (need more jobs and recurring income).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show. Last time we mentioned we wanted to do more content that had practical value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to do a series looking at components that make up websites, and this would allow us to get more specific about design, but also accumulate a library of reusable snippets for future website builds we do on the show. But before that, it probably makes sense to talk about who this is all for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve called this episode Becoming a Better Freelance Web Designer and that&#39;s one of the main reasons behind the show. And I noticed David Waumsley there pointing the finger at himself. How are you doing, David? You all right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&#39;m good. Yeah, this is a little bit self-indulgent, this show, &#39;cause it is really for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I thought I&#39;m perhaps not the only person out there who single handedly is providing. Client building services, websites for local businesses, and probably not the only person in search of a kind of new method, getting back into HML and CSS and also accommodating intrinsic web design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hopefully by, as we&#39;ll see on the show notes, it&#39;s all about what I think I&#39;ve done right and wrong over the last 20 years in terms of, what I&#39;ve learned and how I approach business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. This episode is really an episode in David lying down on the couch and being like, yeah, some sort of psychological analysis of your own, your own endeavors to build websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, interesting. So the idea then of this show is to lay the foundations for future shows in which we build and in quotes, components, bits. For want of a better word, of websites and turn those out as YouTube videos or other types of content. And so this lays the groundwork for who might be interested in that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shall I put the show notes up or we at that point? Yeah. In which case we will go right totto the show notes. I&#39;m just gonna say that if you want to follow along with any of this, then on the screen there is the, the URL where you can find all of this. It&#39;s no script show slash 19. So the digits one, nine, no script show slash 19 if you wanna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out where these bits and pieces are. Okay. Over to you, David. Kick us off, David, what he thinks he got wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so yeah, I broke this up into what I got wrong partly right and where I&#39;m going with this. So I think I Nathan, please add in things that you&#39;ve got. Of course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&#39;s plenty that I got wrong as well, but it doesn&#39;t always overlap with what you got wrong. So that&#39;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, And what, it&#39;s interesting &#39;cause it&#39;s 20 years since I was started building websites and I. Is, I&#39;ve come first circle, but I think I understand things better. So the first thing I&#39;ve put down here is not fully comprehending the nature of the web. And we were talking about this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is true of most of us who came in at a point where web design was already we had. HTML tables. We were already looking at using the web as this visual tool to promote businesses, and we came in as designers doing that where I think most of us skipped the earlier part of the web story that is this free communication tool that would work on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it was a H TM L first thing, I think now because of the fact of intrinsic design, we&#39;ve come full circle all of this a little bit where we&#39;re all saying, actually no, the web is a way of largely communicating to people. I. mostly text-based content and then making it pretty and that just swap, it switches the way I look at the whole business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think there&#39;s a couple of things I would add into there, but basically it&#39;s a rehash of what you said. So the first one is that nobody, I think comprehends the nature of the web does that, because it&#39;s constantly changing. But also, like you said, the endeavor really was to create this kind of network of computers that in the event of a collapse of one part of the infrastructure, it would still find a way to get information from point A to point B. And, and it really was about academics communicating with other academics to share their knowledge and then it got taken over and we don&#39;t need to go into all of that, but it, now it&#39;s very much a, it&#39;s very much tied to businesses and, selling things in your place online, socially, and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, but it does seem that there is a, the beginnings of a ground swelling, getting back to more of the traditional roots, like an open platform. I. To communicate your message out there in a free way that anybody can latch onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know that you are in the baseball to use that phrase. I know that you are inside all of this. I don&#39;t know that message is landing broadly yet. I. But I think it&#39;s beginning to land broadly. I think people are maybe, beginning to have fatigue of being sold at having their data mind and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe we&#39;re at the, cusp of something. And if that&#39;s the case, this podcast is very well timed, well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And also when I was doing the work. it was a friend of mine who dragged me into doing this as a business because she wanted some help with WordPress at the time, and her old business or clients always started because she was in marketing and print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the web was just. An addition. Yep. It was just basically turning print into HT ML. Yeah. And that&#39;s the way that most of us have come in and talk to clients about it. But if we swap it round to the fact that no, it&#39;s a message we&#39;re communicating with HDML, which we then make pretty, I. It, does turn everything upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, with the next thing, my mistake is forgetting the fundamentals, which is HTML stuff. as you get, as we moved into page builders, I got even less in tune with correct markup to make it more accessible and just to make more sense of the. The content itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So yeah, I think we can all be forgiven for going along that road because that was just it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, that was the way, I suppose it had to go for a little period of time. We were all caught up in, can we make it look like this? Can we use this clever, I don&#39;t know, fading technique or sliding technique? Can we get JavaScript to do this thing so that this kind of experience is suddenly possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that&#39;s where we went. And the semantics just went out the window because it was all about the pixels on the page and the way it looked, and the, but the mapping of that is so straightforward. we used to hold magazines in our hand and you could do anything with that if you could print it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was possible. And then we wanted to simulate that on the internet. So that&#39;s what we did for years and we forgot. That it was actually about encapsulating it in this, HTML, the semantics of it. That was, I think, always gonna happen. the prettiness, the pixel pushing, the, making it look nice and to have cool animations and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that was, that had to happen. and then there&#39;d be some sort of nascent rebellion, which is what we feel like we got at the minute. So again. I&#39;m, lie down on the couch, David, you can forgive yourself, I think for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think it&#39;s a good thing, because it&#39;s so simple really to mark up HML fairly effectively so it can reach more people and be usable to, billions of people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that we&#39;re an aging population means that we need to do this even better anyway, if we&#39;re to reach more people. So for the small cost of getting your semantics right with your H two ML. The benefits that you might even get as a business Trying to reach people Yeah. Are great. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. So, here&#39;s another interesting thing as well, is that the, more recent a, amendments to the HTML, sorry, the, the CSS standards and things like that, if you think about it, we had to go through this. pixel pushing. Make it all look pretty in order for CSS to, and again, I&#39;m using air quotes catch up because a lot of the things in CSS seem like they&#39;re trying to simulate what we got in JavaScript, but without JavaScript, if So we&#39;ve got a lot of things coming in that direction, but hopefully if we strip away the JavaScripts, you know the name of the show, no script show. Yeah, that will make the semantics more possible. Everybody will be able to access it on any kind of device, and it will basically be consumable by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s been an intro. This is going off again, but we were talking a bit before about Carousel CSS carousels and we, talked around that and there&#39;s a big debate going on as we&#39;re recording this about that because it turns out these CSS carousels work quite as accessible as they should be, which is okay. Yeah. and you hear lots of conversations about that because, there&#39;s a reaffirming, I think in the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of industry about the fact that we must remember it&#39;s HTML and CSS are predominant there, do JavaScript for anything else that can&#39;t be done by those first two. But above all of that, accessibility is absolute. That must be the most important thing. Everybody should be able to, because that&#39;s what makes the web unique, isn&#39;t it? Through the technology. It can reach everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, interesting. And then the next one, the third one, ignoring the rule of least power and then in brackets, too many dependencies. You had to explain this one to me. So what were you meaning here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I started with has HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t learn it very well. Got into WordPress because that allowed me to do all sorts of dynamic stuff and that, and then with learning that, I couldn&#39;t have done stuff without WordPress, but then it ended up being other jobs came to me because I&#39;d found a way and then particularly a page builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you it didn&#39;t matter if it was a single. Landing page that should have been done with HML and CSS. It suddenly went into this whole bunch of dependencies and you keep building and building upon all these things, forgetting really, that you have to support these and they were never needed, So that was always my mistake, that rule of lease power, that you should start off as simplest possible and as you need it, you add into the pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I do wonder if this one will go away because just stepping away from HTML and CSS and in almost every aspect of the technology landscape, so not just the internet over complication is the stuff of company&#39;s lives, isn&#39;t it? They have to invent new things, pitch those new things, convince us that, we need them all, make them, dependable, reliable, something that you wanna subscribe to if you like. And I dunno how many times I&#39;ve had conversations in the WordPress space in which the, just this massive dependency, headless is a really great example where just so many moving parts to get that to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no doubt there are scenarios where that probably is a decent thing. But for most people it&#39;s not. I don&#39;t know how I think the curious, the nature of humanity, being curious and trying new things out. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s gonna go away, but you don&#39;t need them for almost anything that you want to build as a, I don&#39;t know, client website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don&#39;t need any of those dependencies and telling yourself, I don&#39;t need to waste time on exploring those things is probably, time, saved, shall we say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think it&#39;ll come into our next episodes looking at components. &#39;cause we&#39;ll have to quit because not only the tools that you might use and the dependency on those, but also the extra complicated code that you might code in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That weren&#39;t needed when the message could have been conveyed in a much simpler way. Yeah. So I think, this rule release power is one that I really hold to now, but. Totally lost it. &#39;cause you just get carried away. You just think, yeah, it&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;ve got the system through this tool. I love this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m still massively encapsulated in that universe. I&#39;m still dependent upon so many different things. n Engine X, Apache, my sql, some sort of Linux distribution, in my case. Then PHP, gosh, the list goes on. WordPress, a bunch of plugins. Quite a stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But in your case, nearly everything you are doing relies on a lot of generated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you need something like that. You need some Cs in almost. It does. but it&#39;s slightly different from, I think, some of the client sites that I&#39;ve done, which I should have just used some skills, Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve definitely built client one pager websites, which I&#39;ve done in the page builder, because I knew that I could achieve it more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then it&#39;s gotta have. Some CMS in the background forever. And really that, I&#39;m thinking of one particular case where it still exists. This website is still there and it is a one pager and it&#39;s got a whole CMS behind it. Yeah, makes sense. Updated, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the next one was in forcing systems on clients rather than around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I&#39;m put in brackets, not being agile, I just learned in the way that I think, again, this is something which is probably generic to most people who are. Kind of web designers or front end designers, that we used the waterfall method, didn&#39;t we? We had a A system where we would agree what the design looked like, and then build it and set all this kind of system up for that, where 24 years ago now, some really clever academics in the more development side of things with the more dynamic languages realize that this kind of doesn&#39;t work as a way of building up a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is one of the things that I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve listened to lots of people who say, oh, you need to do this. You need to have this discovery period. You&#39;ll need to run onto this. You need the content first. You need them to provide it through This system just doesn&#39;t work at all. Where if I&#39;m Agile, which is basically saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, we don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll go and explore this and we won&#39;t spend more than what you&#39;re going to get back on it. So we&#39;ll start as simple as possible together. And you&#39;ll pay me for a certain set of work. And then, and that&#39;s work better for me than trying to invent some system because it means that they&#39;re paying for my time and we&#39;re trying to achieve a job, but it&#39;s entirely up to them if we go, it&#39;s their budget, it&#39;s their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, go a different route, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we spent a whole load of time, didn&#39;t we, talking about being agile on the, on the podcast that we do for, the WP Builds podcast. And that was a really interesting journey, and I think your move more towards listening to clients, getting into conversation with clients, basically the whole thing being a conversation Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was, was really transformational for you in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and it makes sense. you can now, I mean it&#39;s taken, billions of pounds or dollars lost with the government projects and stuff to work out that they have to go agile because simply with a big project, if you start off, the technology might be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gotta agree it all and say, these are my aims, because they will not be sensible aims perhaps a year down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, so good point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, so the next thing was certainly in websites, it is the same thing really as various products. So I put beyond my abilities. So for me, I&#39;ve realized that I shouldn&#39;t do things like e-commerce because I really, I rely on somebody else&#39;s technology to do it, and I don&#39;t know enough, I can&#39;t keep up with it, and there&#39;s enough work for me just sticking with basically static sites most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s the sort of shiny object syndrome, isn&#39;t it? I think given the nature of technology, it&#39;s easy to get sucked into those different paths. I decided, as many years ago that e-commerce was not for me. There were just too many headaches there that I knew that I didn&#39;t have the technical capability to troubleshoot if things went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I, think that&#39;s quite a sensible thing, but we&#39;re always being pitched the snake oil of. Yeah, do everything for everybody all the time. And I, don&#39;t know, I think if you know what your limitations are working towards those limitations might be. Might be the best thing that you ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably got less anxiety out of it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. If I want to stay as a single person on my own working, and that&#39;s my business, I need to keep it down to what I can stay up to date with. So what I did WooCommerce for some time, but that changes so greatly that I can&#39;t keep up with that and then learn the other stuff that I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I realized that I&#39;m stretching myself. But also the other thing was just seeing these as products, selling them to clients as products. The agile point again, that you really can&#39;t, you can&#39;t say you&#39;re going to get X project at the beginning of something because you need that room to communicate the direction it might go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you make it to realize. And that&#39;s the agile approach, isn&#39;t it? Yeah. You actually don&#39;t quite know what the end is, and you shouldn&#39;t know what the end is because you need that room. To be able to change your mind. And yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That one&#39;s, kind of about learning what your capabilities are and what you&#39;re comfortable with and, owning that a little bit and being happy in it, not necessarily always trying to find the next North Star that you need to aim at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s it. Okay. I just think, not selling websites as products is problematic. they&#39;re not really a product, are they? they&#39;re a communication tool. The web is a communication tool. It changes. We have to be agile. It&#39;s the nature of the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s not an off, off shelf thing, which begins at this point and ends at that point, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. You buy it and it lasts for so many years. It&#39;s just not, doesn&#39;t work that way. this next, my next one is one you&#39;ve never fallen for, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I, I would just read it out, not taking payments upfront. It sounds like you early on didn&#39;t do that. I&#39;ve never. Not taking payments. There was essentially, I always went for a kind of 40, 40, 20 split, like 40% deposit, 40% on some milestone, and then a final 20%, at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;ve never suffered from that. &#39;cause it just, the wheels would grind to a halt if people didn&#39;t pay. But I never had that even, so that was all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You have to do a waterfall method with that one though, don&#39;t you? You do. So it is easier for me, now because I just say it&#39;s a, basically an agile sprint of work we&#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re buying so many hours where we&#39;ll work on it with this aim. So I can say, pay that upfront and you&#39;ve got these hours and then pay it the next, and you&#39;ve got these hours and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, but again, you&#39;ve passed the test, haven&#39;t you? You&#39;ve been paid upfront, whatever the way of doing it in your case. Non waterfall, in my case, much more waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It, still works, but don&#39;t. Don&#39;t not get paid and do a load of work. Yeah. that&#39;s not great &#39;cause you probably will regret it at some point. It might work out for years. And then one day you&#39;ll, overstep the boundaries or you&#39;ll have a client that just simply refuses to pay. And then the, silliness of that system will become self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ve got the last one on the, what I think I got wrong was not having an escape route. the ability to pass clients on or let clients go free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Which I think, and what did you mean by that? Was this where you&#39;d reached the end of the road of what you could do with them? Or when they came to you and said, look, we need a new website, but we don&#39;t wanna work with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we want the reins of what you&#39;ve already built, though. Hand it all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. Most of the time, luckily I haven&#39;t really had so much un unless there&#39;s been a change of management or person, I haven&#39;t had people wanting to leave. But sometimes I&#39;ve wanted to get rid of certain sites because I don&#39;t want to maintain them because I&#39;ve put all these dependencies in, that, so I&#39;ve had the problem now with certain things where you, picked your tools, so they were WordPress, a certain page builder, a certain set of these things, and they get to a certain point where some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools are no longer, they need changing out. The client&#39;s not really ready for that. And, I can&#39;t, I want to pass these people on for somebody else to look after. &#39;cause I don&#39;t want to look after the maintenance of these sites bar, I can&#39;t do it with, I&#39;m was gonna escape that largely. We doing HML and CSS because, you can, it&#39;s has too, Mel, you should be able to go to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. with your project. So that, I think not having an escape route, it hadn&#39;t really worked out. That in all honesty, the WebPress websites, I&#39;ve got most of the clients who now I would like to be. Either getting them to do something new again or pass, pass them on. They&#39;re 10 years in, more than 10 years, pretty much with the same website that they began with, no work done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s quite remarkable. But they still see it as they want to keep what they&#39;ve had, and I think well. Oh, interesting. We&#39;re gonna have to start again. And I, don&#39;t want to do it in the same way, Yeah. So I can&#39;t pass &#39;em on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. I get it. That makes sense. But hopefully in the future, your html CSS approach, an anybody should be able to pick that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do think you are getting to the point where you are in the 5% of people who can cope with the level of knowledge that you&#39;ve got. I think most people, practi practitioner in this industry. Would not necessarily be able to pick up what you&#39;ve got because they haven&#39;t had the chance to spend the time doing what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the theory is solid. But, I think you&#39;ll only be able to hand things over to a certain subset of people because they won&#39;t know. They, they&#39;ll look at the HTML and the CSF and go, what the heck is that? Yeah. so that&#39;ll be interesting in the Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; If we wanted. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we move on then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go to, what you think you did right, but not very well. You&#39;ve put what he thinks he did right, but did badly. Oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. setting up a recurring income, that was. Good. I think. So that in my case is, I always called it hosting and care and when it was WordPress it needed to have, be cared &#39;cause it needed updating and licenses needed to be paid on certain things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the h ML and CSS version of it, I can still say hosting as well, even though. I&#39;m not paying for it really in the case. there&#39;s so much free options, but really now I just do it where I say, you can update your site with me. I&#39;ll do the updates for you because you haven&#39;t got CMS and also, just to keep me around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, yeah, I think the word hosting is obviously a bit of a weird one there, but it&#39;s the word which is most widely understood. Yes. If you were to just frame it as, I will keep your website online. Yes. That&#39;s just a bit wordy, but basically means the same, thing. &#39;cause it is being hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just not being hosted in the sense that you are familiar with. It&#39;s, if you were to remove the files from the repository where you&#39;ve got them, their website would disappear. but yeah, I know what you mean. But setting up recurring revenue. is definitely a good one. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you ever, I&#39;ve never asked you this before, after all these years, I don&#39;t think, did you ever set up in the first place where you didn&#39;t have a recurring income where you didn&#39;t look after this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you basically built the sites for people and then Yeah. Had peop people come back to you about those sites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That was basically what my business was at the beginning. It was me building a website, shipping it, and then saying, alright, see you later. And then hoping that in a few years time they came back, which they did, but it was this treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of finding new work. However, luckily both you and I started on that journey at a time when people were going from no website to website. Yes. So there was much more of a, the landscape for getting new clients was much bigger. I think now almost every business either has a website. or ha maybe wants to redesign one, but back then most people didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there was just this constant supply of the phone ringing, but I don&#39;t think that would be the case for me anymore. I feel quite lucky with that. Really,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I see I without the recurring, without some kind of retainer to, to stay with certain clients. I think you&#39;ve got this real problem of the fact that you, in order to make money, you could be churning out hundreds of these, and then you&#39;ve got hundreds of people who could randomly at any point turn back to you and say, I&#39;ve got a bit of a problem with the website. Can you fix it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And you&#39;ve got nothing ongoing in, in terms of a relationship with those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I prob I did that for years and it just worked. it was a bit frenetic at times, but it just worked. And then I hopped on the recurring revenue bandwagon and figured out a price point which worked for the clients that I&#39;ve got, which was not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that definitely. Okay. Definitely. Good. What&#39;s the next one? Oh. Love this one. starting with face-to-face contact, you think, you did this a bit, but it was, you were doing it in an overcomplicated way. For me, it was a piece of cake. It was just always whatever form of connection people got in touch with me with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was the phone or email or whatever. I was always gonna get them towards, if they, if their business was local and I could get in the car always that go and actually be in the same room. But if not, get &#39;em on a call. I. Skype was the thing back in the day and always tried to do that &#39;cause I figure I can solve in 10 minutes or I can do more in 10 minutes than I could in a hundred email exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I guess some people are quite good at talking as well. I&#39;m quite good at talking. Yes. That helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. you got this right from the beginning. I didn&#39;t, I think because I was doing it through a friend, I got into the whole email conversations about what they want, which was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got into the face-to-face eventually, like you did, which was sensible. But I still think now I overcomplicated some of the things that we need to do. it was, again, it is got easier and I think it&#39;s gonna get even easier now when I explain. The approach, if you like, this kind of HDML first approach, this idea that, they could be doing it themselves if they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no hard sale, Yeah. I could even teach &#39;em a bit, but we&#39;ll keep adding to this. We&#39;ll make it better and we&#39;ll work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So in an odd way, I think also this, in a, in the future, this might become a bit of a, and I hate to use the word, but I&#39;m gonna, it&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve got superpower, because I think we&#39;re facing like automation and ai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overload and just being a human, just being a person that somebody can hop on a phone call with is gonna be such a, an interesting commodity. I think it&#39;ll be cherished, in the future. And so I think leaning into this is really good. It is. Sure. Is it time consuming? Yeah, of course it&#39;s time consuming, but there&#39;s much more humanity in it and I think it&#39;ll pay dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep going, David. Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what it should be? The thing that we do best in it. Soft skills communicating. that&#39;s what we&#39;re here to do with the design. So if we can&#39;t do it with the clients, it&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s a really great way of thinking about it. If you can&#39;t, if you can&#39;t interface with a client in a way that, you can talk about it, how the heck are you gonna build it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you gonna communicate it if you can&#39;t have a discussion about it, an actual discussion. And email is so any form of written communica so much gets lost, the nuance gets lost. you see that moment when the, you&#39;re talking about a thing and the client&#39;s eyes get a bit wider and they get more heated and talk quicker, it&#39;s oh, that&#39;s the bit that they&#39;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got it. so anyway, there we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and then the last one on this one I&#39;m doing right, but getting it wrong, is encouraging all into the build process. So you know, all the stakeholders in it. Generally it&#39;s just one person, so not such a problem. But sometimes with the bigger organizations, everybody, I include them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was brilliant when I used to do it. I was a big fan of getting clients involved in the page builder. Yeah. Page builder. Yeah. Yeah. Was the real leveler. Yep. because they didn&#39;t need the skills. We could work together on this stuff and there was some good in that, some really good moments out of doing that, but also it just introduced them to ways to be able to mess up their own websites as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. Yeah. Yeah. Where now I think if I&#39;m doing it, I still wanna encourage them into the, into exactly what I&#39;m doing as much as they&#39;re interested in. In terms of getting the messaging, maybe understanding some basic case, how it&#39;s put together. I&#39;m keen if they&#39;re interested in that. So it&#39;s a, I want people to be involved in it, but I just, I wouldn&#39;t do it in that way with the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No. Okay. Okay. All right. Let&#39;s move on to this. Is the moment, really the bits that you think you&#39;ve got right. With a few caveats towards the end? Yeah. okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. there&#39;s a bit of a. Bit of a gripe here in that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so not excluding low budget work, family, or friends is one of the things that, that&#39;s why I put the little, asterisks against that because that&#39;s, controversial in a lot of circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s been really good because just taking on any work means that I don&#39;t have to spend any time on marketing. It just means people come up and I find a way to meet them where they are. That&#39;s. Something that Paul Lacey said that term, I liked it. and I think that&#39;s really good because actually long term they&#39;re, they&#39;ve been the most loyal people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they&#39;re with me, some of these. brother&#39;s site will be going back almost 20 years, so he is probably given me more money than any client has up to this point, Interesting. Yeah. And so I think I got that right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe, it&#39;s a function of you though. Maybe there is something in this one that people do wanna avoid because, maybe you are somebody that finds yourself getting hot under the collar and falling out with people if they don&#39;t listen or behave in a way that you anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I think you are quite a. A relaxed kind of approach to most things. So maybe that works in your favor, when the client does something and then on does it all in a heartbeat and creates lots of work for you, maybe you are able to roll with that a little bit better. So I can see why that rule might not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s totally worked. I&#39;ve worked with, family and friends. I was just telling you, I&#39;ve agreed to do a website for. a friend basically in the near future. Very happy to do that. it&#39;s actually philanthropic, so it&#39;s a little bit different, but, yeah, I would agree with that. it has worked for me too, but what are the, what are the caveats?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you wanna say them out loud or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, I&#39;ll say it was just because of the fact that I&#39;m saying that, and a lot of people would jump at me on this one. There are bunch of statements which I reject, which I used to hear particularly, I think more in sort of Facebook groups in the. Page builder circles and there would be these things that grind my gear, so I&#39;ll just go through &#39;em, which is, clients aren&#39;t interested in the tools you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients are only interested in the value you bring. You are the expert, not them. Clients without X budget are not serious. And these are all things that I think are the last things that perhaps page builders should use. And I think they come from these kind of. Business courses for page builder users that are a little bit like the online trader courses and apps that you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re led by motivational speakers who sell you the dream of a lifestyle, tell you what the secret formulas are for dealing with it, but they don&#39;t concentrate on whether you&#39;ve got the skills to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, I think that&#39;s those kind of things. that&#39;s the hook, isn&#39;t it? they can sell you this dream, but if you don&#39;t have the skills to match, it doesn&#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;ve always taken the approach, and you&#39;ve said this I think prior to hitting record, that essentially there&#39;s gotta be a little bit of, skepticism. Because if somebody truly is that person, why are they packaging it? I&#39;m selling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Telling it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. You would keep hush or you would be the industry leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody would be doing what you are doing. You wouldn&#39;t have a secret any longer, would you? No, exactly. so yeah, and they generally don&#39;t talk, and I think with all of those who are a little bit dangerous because of the fact that, there is a. Some truth, obviously, truth in all of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if a client doesn&#39;t have enough certain budget, you may, because of the way that your organization works, you have a limit. There&#39;s always some sort of, top level. But to just set this and to say that people can&#39;t have a website, It just go, it grates me my gear so much because the, web was given to us for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, nice. So anybody can, It was so anybody can get HTM l document out that explains on their domain to reach everybody. That&#39;s a freebie. We come in and we improve upon that with our skills that we bring to it. So I think when somebody says if they don&#39;t have X money, they shouldn&#39;t be on the web. It&#39;s just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that, that, that&#39;s a really interesting framing of that argument. I love that. So the web, H-T-M-L-C-S-S is free, and we come on and finesse it. And so the idea of closing people out, you, have no business having a website without X number of, let&#39;s say dollars down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yes. Yes you do. Yes, you totally do. It&#39;s, free. It&#39;s, almost like a human, Okay. So there&#39;s all the caveats as well, Then, sorry, that was my rant. no. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. It&#39;s good to see the pitchforks coming out a little tiny bit. the next one then is not specializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think you&#39;ve got that right? you&#39;re glad about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Because I think a lot of people will say, particularly these business courses, that you need to find a niche. And I think that&#39;s true in the sense of what you do and the person you do the locality or in on all those kind of things put you in a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think trying to say, I only do this type of websites, I do websites for plumbers only or for vets, Sonia, I think no, because the skills we should be bringing are these front end generic skills. These things about being able to communicate through HTML, the message of someone, and I&#39;m not gonna be an expert in veterinary practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and be a, that they&#39;re good to be the expert. My job is to use my general skills, soft skills to be able to pull out what their messages is within their specialty. So I think no, I&#39;m, I&#39;ve decided a generalist is perfect given what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, precisely Given what you do. And also, if there&#39;s a really nice project that you turn down, because it&#39;s not a vet website, that seems such a shame, you might learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much during that and enjoy the process and they&#39;re just the perfect client in every way. But Are you a vet? No, I&#39;m so sorry. we and I set up We have no business doing your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, exactly. And if I set up, David&#39;s website, building for vets or something, and then Nathan comes along in the same area and says, I&#39;ve got even better vet sites, You know what I mean? Get into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I do, This is something I&#39;ve mulled over for a long time. My skills regarding vet&#39;s websites, as opposed to yours. I, I dimmu, I think, I think you&#39;re probably better. Next one then. Critically assessing to keep costs down. Oh, yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:05] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you have always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are much better at this than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Checking out the backgrounds of people into whether there&#39;s something that&#39;s something I&#39;ve done with sort of page builders. I trust the people and look into them, not just what they&#39;re selling me, and I&#39;ve done it a lot with hosting as well, which has saved clients money, I think, because hosting can be really expensive and they&#39;ll sell you a whole load of stuff you don&#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I&#39;ve always jumped onto the easiest way to be able to do the hosting that I think is safe enough for me to be able to manage. anyway, there&#39;s not much of a point on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but I, think you&#39;re right. I was always taking intuitions from you about those kind of things. &#39;cause you would always do the research, whereas I just generally didn&#39;t ever get to Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More due diligence on yeah. Exactly. Being marketed at me. Yeah. and then I, guess our final section Yes. So is what you&#39;re trying to solve now, what&#39;s going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; on? Yeah, better messaging. So I need to talk to clients. I need to get over this intrinsic design. I need to get over this. What I&#39;ve been saying through this is this kind of content first over pretty pictures of websites thing that we&#39;ve been stuck in for the last, I don&#39;t know, 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s, what I&#39;ve gotta get much better at being able to get this over to clients I think. And, the next one really, which is just the lead up, this is our segue to the rest of nicely on the episodes, is, we need faster building with snippets, which is why we&#39;re going to stop looking at all these components, because I need them for more jobs and more recurving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So the intention for you, as a business is to have a collection of. Tried and tested bits of websites, components of websites that you yourself can reuse, store them in some repository of your own confection. but also as a nice gesture is to demonstrate on YouTube videos like this, how you have gone about doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building them from the ground up, what they do, how they do it, how you could copy and simulate what David&#39;s doing so that you don&#39;t have to do. All the hard work sounds like, sounds like fun. So is that, the plan then to start doing those fairly soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think so. Hopefully I&#39;m putting him on the spot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause we&#39;re mentioning, we, hopefully we might have our previous guest, Paul might come and join us where we can just talk a bit about what components we do. Because big debate I, for me is I want to simplify everything. So every time I start to look at any kind of component you make, I just think, do we need this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no. But that, I think that&#39;s brilliant. I think that&#39;s a really good way of approaching it. Certainly from the. the accessibility point of view, the optimization point of view, the SEO point of view, all of it feeds into that. So rather than starting with everything, being bloated and then installing things so that you can undo the bloat work from the basis of, do I need this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And only if it needs to go in, put it in, it&#39;d be a fascinating journey. Yeah. so you are, we&#39;re calling those components and the idea then is that, over the next weeks, months, whatever, joined by Paul Lacey. I guess from time to time, is to build out those components and show how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;d be nice. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I&#39;ll be stealing from everybody, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; But that&#39;s the nature of the web, right? It&#39;s, and it&#39;s not called stealing by the way. It&#39;s, it&#39;s borrowing, I think honoring honor. Yeah, that&#39;s right. Be honoring many people. That&#39;s right. You will be mentioning them by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if that&#39;s the case. And we&#39;ve come to the end of that one. Is the, is it time to say farewell? It is. that was interesting. So now we know what David&#39;s good at and what he&#39;s not very good at by his own submission. And, hopefully yeah, in the near future, we&#39;ll start doing a bunch of content related to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like practical, how to videos about little web-based components, bits and pieces that you can use to make your own workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I like that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the format that we might do, because it gives us a chance to look at just one part of a website and talk about the UX and the design. Yep. And even SEO and, pull it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where before, where we were starting to build sites, we, it was a bunch of code that we just had to skim over quickly. Yeah. So we can start to really hone in on the Cody stuff, but also the. Where it fits into the design. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; like that. Yeah, me too. I&#39;ve got some ideas which I&#39;ll share after I&#39;ve stopped this video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll speak to you in a few seconds, but thank you. If you&#39;ve been listening or watching, really appreciate it. Thanks, David. Thanks. Bye bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Programmatic CSS. Where is this going?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/18/" />
    <updated>2025-05-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/18/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;css-changes&quot;&gt;CSS changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-as-a-programming-language&quot;&gt;CSS as a  programming  language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It always was in the sense it tells a computer what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But as a declarative language it does not give the control expected from an imperative language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrinsic web design seems to demand a programmatic approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS programming is more about giving better hints to the browser (which has to protect content for users).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-s-direction&quot;&gt;CSS’s direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown as it’s shaped by consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The W3C (with global stakeholders) sets standards aimed to empower humanity, but it can’t enforce them.
-The W3C thinks about long term problems. The commercial world thinks about short term solutions (tortoise and the hare?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-programming&quot;&gt;CSS programming?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css.oddbird.net/sasslike/mixins-functions/&quot;&gt; @function and mixins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/&quot;&gt;Inline :if() conditionals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has&quot;&gt;Trigonometry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has&quot;&gt;:has().&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors&quot;&gt;Relative color.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular design components that relied on JavaScript to display content are becoming achievable with HTML and CSS.  Examples:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.dev/carousel-configurator/&quot;&gt;carousel configurator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/bGPjBQe/f5761a4ef1339f38668ca7098d0bda26&quot;&gt;accordions&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/jOeKzpb&quot;&gt;popups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If CSS is giving us a programmable flexibility model for web styling this will have an impact on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;handcoders&quot;&gt;Handcoders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_3pRxdv-cI&quot;&gt;Kevin Powell learned&lt;/a&gt; many CSS fans get upset then CSS becomes hard to read. The dynamic CSS breaks with the old view of it as  a simple presentational code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;page-builders&quot;&gt;Page Builders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WYSIWYG and CSS in a UI does not really work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coping-with-more-complex-css&quot;&gt;Coping with more complex CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we can avoid overwhelm by starting with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX design begins with content and uses design rules (color, proximity spacing) to make that content more manageable for users. This can be applied intrinsically in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we start with semantic HTML most of our accessibility and performance problems are prevented. The message becomes the priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only need to know the fundamentals of CSS (The cascade, display modes, alignment and sizing) to manually create a decent looking website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generators and recipes from W3C experts can build on that to give us  more flexible layouts and complex components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt; Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello and welcome to the No Script Show. New CSS specifications are coming faster than we can understand them. If we tried to cover them all at one time, we would probably not be able to see the wood for the trees. So instead, we&#39;re going to step back and see if we can understand the overall direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, making this show hang together, doing all the work really is. David, how. I&#39;m good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m, the reason for this episode really is that I&#39;m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by all of this kind of programmatic CSS that we&#39;re starting to see all these if statements and that function and all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t keep up. And I love, I&#39;ve just got into CSS and I, really love it and I&#39;ve found a way to make it simple. And now my head is mush again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I ask you a question? Yes. how good were you at. Programming, because I always, it always bamboozled me. I could always see that there were people significantly better at retaining the concepts after reading a page in the day when you and I learned everything was in a physical book with pages that you would turn and, and I would remember getting to the end of whole chapters thinking I&#39;d got it, and then restart the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think, oh. Actually, I&#39;ve forgotten more or less everything that happened. I was never good at programming, basically. So I could see why maybe this would cause you, some level of fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I. Yeah, and it&#39;s also, but because I did a little presentation for your thing that you do, this page builder summit where I&#39;ve been thinking, talking to page builder users like I was and trying to encourage &#39;em to look at CS s and how wonderful it is and you realize that you&#39;ve got all this kind of, if you try and pick things up from YouTube videos, now you can really get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause everybody&#39;s excited about all this new kind of dynamic stuff that&#39;s coming into CSS. So you could really. Get lost in all of that, which I&#39;m starting to do. So I need this in a way, partly because if anybody does see that presentation comes here, it might be a bit of a follow on from what was tried to say there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, it&#39;s about, me. Try just getting my head straight again, if you like, and recapping on what we&#39;ve been doing with this show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I guess if you were to look at it from a long way off, if you were to have distance and perspective, better to have. Things to learn, then it&#39;s stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although that&#39;s, it&#39;s easy to say, but better to have things that are happening, exciting things, difficult maybe, but better that it&#39;s, that it&#39;s moving on and pushing forwards and getting more complicated and therefore the options available to, developers, the youths, David, the young ones who are gonna come along and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just grasp it in a heartbeat. it&#39;s, better, it is better for the web in general. okay. that&#39;s the message here. do you want me to put the Yes. Just have the notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;ll help me Yeah. To wander through this Yeah. So if we can start on just what&#39;s changing at the moment and basically this, because I&#39;m saying programmatic language, and I see other people in groups and stuff saying, oh, so CSS is becoming a programming language now, and I think there&#39;s been a long debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a good CSS Tricks article actually, about that, where I think, was it Chris Coyer? Getting very frustrated when people say, is that a program in language and. I know others do. Hayden Pickering, is quite sharp with people who&#39;s, who say that it isn&#39;t that CSS isn&#39;t a programming language &#39;cause they say, yes it is, works on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that definition, it is a programming language, but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it is in that way. But if you Google it now, which I did just before the show there, it says, no, not really. It&#39;s a presentational language. Okay. so you get into this for ages, but I think the key thing is, we&#39;ve mentioned this on the show before, but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is a big difference I think, in code, and I think this is the thing I&#39;ve had to get my, there&#39;s a sort of. A feeling that all code is difficult, which I think is why people will be attracted to page builders as I was when code when CSS appeared difficult to me. but I think there is a difference between the declarative languages of HTML and CSS, where you only get to hint what the browser does, and the browser has to protect the content for the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can be bad at coding with. HT ML and CSS and the browser knows to ignore all the rubbish shoes stick in there. And just display everything it can, which is not the case with the traditional imperative languages that because they have to work, someone has to have control what they coding via logic, which is what I&#39;m not very good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m No, they, that&#39;s, that encapsulates it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s me too. Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And they were, and there was a JavaScript and PHP on those, on that, and I. but what&#39;s interesting, I think for me, this is my understanding of it, when we get to the programming language we&#39;re talking about, and I think what we&#39;re seeing here is the stuff that&#39;s been introduced that we&#39;ll call a programming language is about still sticking with the declarative stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s more about giving better hints Yeah. To the browser in the, fact that we now have. Intrinsic web design where we need to tell the, browser to do some mass on our behalf to display things in a way that we want them. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Yeah. So, in, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; no. That was basically it. I am, my own, trying to get my head around this is that CSS is still this simple declarative language where we say, we&#39;d like this to be read, but okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser, if they use us, says they, want a forced color on it. You, don&#39;t give &#39;em our red, that&#39;s fine. I can live with that. It&#39;s still that sort of simple thing which we can deal with as communicators. I think intrinsic design. Requires because of the programmatic side. What Jen Sim said in the very first like episode we said about this, we&#39;re now programming a flexibility model for the wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that the demands of all the different devices we have to serve now means that we need that kind of stuff to be in our CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think it, what&#39;s been really nice about CSS is it has been really forgiving. If you do something that basically doesn&#39;t work, it still works, nothing will collapse and you&#39;re not going to be, at the end of the road if you do something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say for example with, PHP in the CMS that I use WordPress, then there&#39;s a total catastrophe. Everything just breaks. And so it&#39;s been very forgiving, but also it&#39;s limiting. And so throwing in components of. Programmability. it&#39;s not really programming, but it&#39;s got little aspects, little hints of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing presumably is really going to break. It just won&#39;t look the way you want it. So it&#39;s still presentational, but I think this is the way it needs to go. the shame though is that I&#39;m now elderly. learning all these new things will probably be something that I will do from afar. It&#39;ll only be at the point where I actually need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting though, because. You were mentioning about page builders and things like that, it will be interesting to see if it is possible to force this into a UI of a page builder at some point. I&#39;m struggling to see how that would be possible given how things work at the moment, because you&#39;ve got this really limited palette of things that you can do in CSS, and so page builders can pretty much do all of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that we&#39;re moving to a much more kind of ephemeral. You don&#39;t quite know how anything&#39;s gonna look given any screen size. You, have some intuition, but it&#39;s not quite gonna be there. It&#39;ll be interesting to see. How that works. &#39;cause view ports and widths of view ports and all of that is going, out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So I think that&#39;s, I mean I think it&#39;s, the problem with the CSS is never one thing and I think even more so it&#39;s, now two things. So I imagine now if I&#39;m not good at. logical programming and, the mentality you need to have that it probably doesn&#39;t matter because there are other CSS experts who make generators that I can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. As long as I understand how they work and what values need to be changed, that&#39;s probably all I need to know because at the end of most of the hard work is done by the browser these days, isn&#39;t it? Yeah. We&#39;re just telling it how to do. it is hints again to the browser. So it does all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you become an aficionado of, these generators then? Have you got a nice long list of generators to achieve particular things? is it a case of you have to go and Google to find the generators or are they all housed in one place? Is there one authority that seems to be really good at creating those kind of generators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we, otherwise we end up, there&#39;s a danger of going back to the bad old days of learning CSS where you go to stack overflow and Right. Pay somebody&#39;s solution into your sheets. So I think I am very, there are things like, utopia as a. Fluid typography, generator is the thing that I start off with that again, that may have to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s sort of things that impact on that. We get trigonometry coming to CSS as well, which means that you could, rather than have this. Absolute linear, straight line, linear change from your font sizes, you could tail that off or whatever with this. So there, there might be changes that happen with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. mi and Suzanne talked about fluid typography. One of the big bugs that she&#39;s got at the moment is that she likes big font sizes. on websites. But if she sets her own screen to a big font size, these will relatively grow. Yeah. So some, of the sites that she likes who are big font sizes, she makes them look a bit too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. If she gives, that&#39;s her preference. Anyway, sorry. Yeah. No, It&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. She&#39;s an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. But yes, up to now that&#39;s the best thing and that&#39;s what she uses as well. Yeah. Utopia. And reason I like that is because the people behind it Clear Left is the company behind it. We&#39;ve got Jeremy Keefe behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s somebody who&#39;s, at least has to go through the process that he wrote. The more definitive guide on HTML five, so somebody who, you can trust to yeah. Know what&#39;s going on in the wc. So I&#39;d be very cautious about any generator there. But I think, we&#39;ll actually, I&#39;ll move through some, I&#39;m jumping so far ahead on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll, yeah, it&#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; let&#39;s reign it back in. And should we go back to our document on the screen? yes. So if you&#39;re listening to this, then it&#39;s on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah, so we&#39;ll just talk a little bit. Yeah. one of the things I was doing that presentation for your event there, and I suddenly thought, am I sounding like the W three C has got a plan or something in mind with the direction we&#39;re going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don&#39;t think they do because I think when we are looking at CSS direction, we always, it&#39;s always unknown because it&#39;s always done by consensus with the stakeholders that have been involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that&#39;s the case with anything like this though, isn&#39;t it? You see a direction because it&#39;s had a trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look over your shoulder, you know it&#39;s gone from there to here. So it must have a direction from here to somewhere in the future. And of course, it really doesn&#39;t, there isn&#39;t that kind of times arrow approach to it. but it, because it&#39;s a more of a community based. project, but there must be some threads that we can pull out of, okay, it&#39;s very likely to go in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would&#39;ve thought, but no, there&#39;s no way of, actually, no. maybe in the very near term we know, but in the, I think in the decade long term, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think we can, the one thing about reconnecting with the W three C and what&#39;s going on there and the debates there, is that you do get some hint about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, you do know the future to a certain degree. At least you know what&#39;s coming to browsers, right? what&#39;s been agreed on. So in line, if statements is something agreed on, but it&#39;s not appeared in our browsers, a lot of stuff is appearing very quickly. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Tsunami is coming, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But also you could see the discussions and I think the big discussion has been as getting right back, as we&#39;ve been saying on the show for to the beginnings again and this HTML first, and then, it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web always has to protect the content, always. So we style around it and now everything has to be fluid. We have to start getting back that way. And it&#39;s very difficult if you&#39;ve been in, what I&#39;ve been doing is creating visual designs for clients with a page builder to switch, switch that entirely upside down because you&#39;ve always started with the static design in your head of which you&#39;re trying to recreate with the, so you really having to flip that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greatly to be able to get. And I think once you do that, you line yourself up with what as the conversations that always come out of the W three C. So you know that we are heading that way and we know that technically we have to head that way because how else will we accommodate all the browsers if all the different sorry devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know what you mean. yeah. So I do think we get caught as well. And the direction&#39;s difficult. &#39;cause I think there&#39;s, I, put a little note here just saying that W three C. did I write it? Yeah. Oh, it&#39;s not in its own point, but the W three C thinks about long-term problems. That&#39;s its mainly focus, so it&#39;s very cautious where the commercial world thinks more short-term solutions all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have this, yeah, I think you have this tortoise and hair situation going on all the time where, you know, In a time where CSS hasn&#39;t sorted out problems of being responsiveness, if you like, in the early two thousands and tens. So I think page builders have grown very strongly because they had a much better short term solution for the fact that we needed to, Sort out these designs. We did it. Yeah, Just what I mean. And I think it had its time where it solved the problems, but now I think it&#39;s flipping the other way that the tortoise is catching up because they&#39;ve thought it&#39;s taken a long time to get grid out there. It&#39;s taken like 10 years of trying to get grid, a proper layout system and it&#39;s taken all this time, but I think now it&#39;s started things really speeded up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the tortoise. The W three C in my mind is overtaking the hair, which has been a lot of our research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; solutions. Yeah, it&#39;s interesting as well, because if you think about it, we are trying to put pixels on a page at the end of the day. That&#39;s it. And we&#39;ve had, what, 20 odd years of trying to get this right in air quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, I wonder how much innovation there actually is. how many, how long can we keep innovating in putting pixels on pages in interesting ways? And maybe that&#39;s just the problem. For the last 20 years, there have been ways to innovate, okay, we want this. Kinda masonry style layout, or we want things to overlap each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, when we narrow the viewport, we want the text to grow or the text to shrink, or things to just collide with each other or disappear. You get what I&#39;m saying? But the point being, can we continue to innovate the way that we do layouts? And if that&#39;s not the case, if there is an end to that road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&#39;s where we&#39;re at with the WC three. sorry. W three C. Maybe it&#39;s because there is a more of an end in sight. There. There is a limitation to how innovative we can be with our layouts and it&#39;s taken the commercial things. So push, demonstrate what might be possible and now the standards based approach can kindly finally catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there isn&#39;t too much runway left, if That&#39;s, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything in that really, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I, I would question though, the first thing you said there about, you we&#39;re just trying to put pixels on a page and I think, no, I think this is where a lot of it&#39;s gone wrong. I think I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we&#39;re trying to use the web to communicate with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah, and I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s the starting point. And in communicating we often, which is generally text-based, we then need to, as any good designer for, UX needs. To do is to make that something where you can quickly, where you can easily and comfortably see that content, and it&#39;s easy to understand the hierarchy of that content, what&#39;s important in that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the rest of what we&#39;re doing is essentially presenting. messaging. Yeah, that, so I like that I start from that point of view. and I think that&#39;s the, we, I think if we get back to the origins of the web, which has got lost along the way, is the fact that this is a, an information sharing tool for everybody to be able to use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody should be able to write and get their website on there, get their message out, and then it&#39;s the levels. From there of styling that we do that gets it more professional. So anybody can do a basic styling and make it looks quite presentable, but then you know why we&#39;ll always be in need of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if everybody can make their own simple websites and communicate. That&#39;s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; There&#39;s a profession for us in expanding that, and I think if we start from that perspective rather than pixels on the page, we&#39;ve already set ourselves that we&#39;re creating a visual medium of which in that we are stuffing in our messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That is interesting. Yeah, I like that. I like that. Yeah. Also, whilst you were saying all of that, it suddenly occurred to me that everything is driven by the current state of the tech that we have. hold the physical tech. So you know, we start with computers, two dimensional interface, it&#39;s quite large, the screen, and then we move to things more rectangular based in our hands, and I have no idea what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will come in that sphere. Maybe we&#39;ll be looking at the internet through glasses or goggles, or maybe there&#39;ll be just some sort of three dimensional presentation layer that will, I don&#39;t know, will augmented reality will become something interesting. And so this two dimensional, flat, rectangular thing that we face either in our hand or on a screen, maybe that will be supplanted by something as, and then this whole thing will start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ll put it as notes later because it&#39;s interesting &#39;cause E even in the thing that you do on with the WP builds, I was listening into one of the chats there about, a website&#39;s important any longer. Then there&#39;s another debate going on about how much clients need to be charged to start a website and they so depressed me these conversations because I thought if we get back to the way, I&#39;m now starting to see it as this is all a, good, a global communication tool that anyone can actually use and that we try and make it more beautiful and presentable to the different mediums You. All that kind of stuff doesn&#39;t make any sense any longer. Why is it gonna dissipate? What, what&#39;s gonna happen to communication? So yes, if you think of it as a way of putting visuals onto the web, then I can see why all these different technologies are very threatening or why it might, if you&#39;ve got that sort of level, but, and why you might need to charge so much if that&#39;s the expectation. But if you start with the fact that, it&#39;s, I&#39;ve shown my information, my life, my business, whatever, I&#39;m there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everybody. It. It starts to, that disappears a little bit. Yeah, and I think it&#39;s a better way of talking about it, because then we say, okay, it is HT ML first. It is our messaging first, and then actually even as designers, we should take a UX approach where we start with the content and style around it to make it presentable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s always been designed anyway, so yeah, I do like your, I do like the way you think deeply about these things. I&#39;m more on the, it&#39;s a 2D surface with pixels on a page and you&#39;ve got this, you&#39;ve got a whole philosophy behind it, which is fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But it is not though, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is just the fact that I, because I&#39;ve taken myself off into something I&#39;m uncomfortable with, right? I&#39;ve had to think, how do I get, this is what I&#39;m doing here. I&#39;m talking aloud. It&#39;s just my, so the reason why I&#39;m coming out with this stuff is &#39;cause I&#39;m thinking. Yeah, I can&#39;t balance this all out in my own head, but I&#39;m getting Yeah, you&#39;re trying to, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;re trying to figure You&#39;re still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Yeah, so we don&#39;t know what the CSS direction is. Basically, the long and the short of that whole thing was we can&#39;t be sure. We have some vague intuitions based upon what&#39;s coming into browsers and things like that, but certainly the long term view. We really are unsure &#39;cause it&#39;s a, yeah, it&#39;s an on, it&#39;s an ongoing project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So CCSS programming, is it a programming language? What&#39;s coming, what&#39;s here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and this is why I thought, our show should be taking each of these and talking about &#39;em, but I just thought, I dunno how I would use &#39;em, which we, were talking about earlier. So we, have. Function functions and mixings come in and I think app function is something that we can already try in Chrome at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s come very quickly. that&#39;s Miria and Suzanne&#39;s who put forward that project. So anybody who knows the kind of pre-process like SaaS will know mixings. You can create these little, if you like, little tokens, which can, but even, I can&#39;t remember. I. I started to learn a little bit of SAS before realizing I probably don&#39;t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet it comes to native CSS and here it&#39;s coming. yeah, and it does allow you, again to have a bit of programming in your, in your style sheets somewhere to affect the rest of your style sheets. But how we use it, I don&#39;t dunno. So I thought, let&#39;s just cover these. there&#39;s inline if statements or conditionals that are coming in as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; idea. I have no idea how that could be used. We talked before we hit record, that&#39;s still a. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Leah Varu is the person who put that forward about a year ago, and then that might be sometime coming to browsers. But, it&#39;s a kind of like an improvement, on query and something. we&#39;ve got trigonometry, which is I think pretty much already there in the sense that we, we can do more with our calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, would that have to be so linear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That word literally triggers trigger geometry, triggers my. Yes. You dunno much about geometry thing. Yeah, exactly. oh really? Do we need that? Okay. Yeah, no, it&#39;d be really useful. genuinely useful if you can apply math to the screen and what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:05] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you hope people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; will do clever stuff. We generate, which there&#39;s bound to be a ton of people out there who will just run with this and they just understand maths in a way that I just do not, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be wonderful. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll come into the, typography, generators at some point, or might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna say that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s gonna be a case where the generator will be my best friend. I will not be doing any of that by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m not sure the same will it will get. I know, because I know there&#39;s a. There&#39;s been discussions between somebody who&#39;s mad on making demos all the time. Adam Arga, who works on the Chrome dev team, is also in the W three C and Matts OTT as well, who talked a lot previously about trigonometry and how it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think they&#39;ve been, I. Not that they&#39;ve come up with something, but combining that with relative colors, which is another one on my list there, you might be able to do some really clever dynamic programming of your whole palettes, if you like. Yeah, that&#39;d be interesting. but certainly elements within your palette, like the way I&#39;m using it at the moment, so I, am now, even though it&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s only got about 96% support, but I am using relative color just to put that formula as it breaks up the channels into a hover on the button. So whatever my color is at the top of the theme, I don&#39;t have to create a new one for the dark. I just let whatever that one is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, Button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So, anyway, but I think clever stuff with that and has, is one that I have managed to get my head around that&#39;s already widely usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exactly. And already because of the way that it works, because it&#39;s. the parents like to things that in your child can change how the parent behaves. You can use it for switches that you would need JavaScript for before, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that kind of just leans really into what we already know, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s, no great surprises there. You&#39;re just leveraging the language of what&#39;s already there. So it you might be trying to find a child and then the child affects the parents and, it that, I think that&#39;s easy to understand. There&#39;s, a lot of the cascade in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And and I dunno, my head can pause that one much more straightforwardly than the if for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yes. And I, but even that, you get, I think these things take time first. &#39;cause there was a lot of tricks that I used that I shown in when we were doing our websites were, one of those was the generator as well, that was creating a grid so you could put your content in kind of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example really is in a blog post where you might want your centered text fade type. So it&#39;s readable. You can read, it&#39;s not too many characters long. but then you want something to break out and normally you would&#39;ve to create your own diviv for your breakout. And then. Another div again to put things back center where you use this grid and you use the name lines to be able to say, oh, okay, I want you to go from this start name line to this start name line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element. So those are calculators that do and the fluid, again, because you are, your calculating the sort of gap it narrows as you get. So in the same way that typography does, it sort of stretches. So a lot of that, and I lost my point. I did have a point where I was going, With this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh yes, it was, that was an example of something which I heard of. &#39;cause Rachel Andrews mentioned it before. Grid was fully supported in 2017, but it took until about 2000 and I think maybe a couple of years ago for somebody like Kevin Powell to make it more widespread because he discovered it for himself independently, that you could do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so it&#39;s interesting in how I think a lot of the stuff we&#39;ve got now will take ages for us to work out. Oh, we could. Combine this with that and do this that we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. &#39;cause you&#39;ve got the, they&#39;ve got two pieces to it really. You&#39;ve got the learning how it works. Yes. And then off the back of that, once you onto people have learned how it works, then it&#39;s those same people figuring out how best to use it in ways that the rest of us can say, oh yeah, actually that, makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so it&#39;s all very well throwing trigonometry in, but really until somebody shows me that&#39;s really useful. That affects a website in a positive way, then it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s an academic paper. It&#39;s, yeah, that&#39;s fun to have trigonometry in there, but until I can see I can do that and it makes sense and the client will think that, that&#39;s a marvelous innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll, I&#39;m gonna be sitting on the fence, I suppose waiting, watching the cleverer people figure it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; one thing you mentioned to me, &#39;cause you said we should do something on it, is that the thing that&#39;s happening now is all these kind of popular design components that used to rely on JavaScript are slowly finding their way into HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, yep. And to me that makes perfect sense. It has to, we have to get away from JavaScript that will affect content because JavaScript will break in the browser. JavaScript is an imperative language. That&#39;s the beauty of the declarative language. We only get to hint. But the browser can change, the web can change, and our code doesn&#39;t break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I, it&#39;s logical, isn&#39;t it, that more of this stuff is gonna come out of JavaScript when it&#39;s at the front end and has the potential to break and not be a, and stop the web from evolving. Yeah. Yeah, So I think, but I think we&#39;re getting some really good stuff. So obviously the, I&#39;ll bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that people will be able to see this in the audio, but, we&#39;ve got the, carousel thing, Adam Margas project they&#39;ve been doing. It&#39;s now available in Chrome everywhere where you&#39;ve got these, carousels is called, but it&#39;s used in so many different ways. Yeah. Once you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. it&#39;s not a carousel in terms of the, I forget what the terminology is, but these sort of scroll. score markers that we have and, basically it&#39;s another set of terminology, but we can use these to do whole pages carousels. Tabs we&#39;ve got on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; all sorts of, different,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them just look, they&#39;re just so sublimely nice, aren&#39;t they? Look at those. Yeah. Much as I hate to, he&#39;s called it horizontal cards. I&#39;m calling it a slider. But, yes. it&#39;s, I kinda have this whole thing of I don&#39;t really like sliders, but honestly there&#39;s something beguiling about it all being done with just CSS and, the fact that you can do, look, look at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s just look, finger size buttons that are round, that your finger just really navigate towards. It&#39;s beautiful. There&#39;s always gonna, I,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; think they&#39;ve solved the problem with this set of, it&#39;s called carousels. I think that&#39;s really misleading because the set of new stuff that we&#39;ve got in there just allows us to play and it&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still just hide and show stuff. This point points where we need things to be contained in a little box somewhere where we hide it away as secondary content. We&#39;ll always need that and effectively. talking about S slider, I think being terrible because we&#39;ve got this concept of it, but effectively these are all, they&#39;re all versions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; of sli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. There&#39;s one thing, which is the focus and everything else is somehow receiving some kind of hidden state, I suppose it&#39;s less hidden there, but the, they&#39;re great. They&#39;re really great. So I&#39;ll just speak this into the, the URL is Chrome dev slash carousel. yes, if you wanted to go and check out, there&#39;s, so there&#39;s so many interesting examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are just wild, like wildly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And I went to the configurator there, so they&#39;ve got a little configurator so you can start to work out what your code is. And this is again, another example of a generator where I think all of us will need to. To turn these on to see what the code means so we can use it in our projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, anyway, let me go back. Yep. and there&#39;s another one which I&#39;ve been looking into, which is accordion. So only very, just recently, with Accordions. Now, because you use it on your site, we have the, summary details and summary. Yes. Summary. Yeah. Tags. and with that, I mean they are disclosure, patterns as they&#39;re called in W three C where they disclose the information that&#39;s in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are great by default because they are, and I didn&#39;t really realize this, I. That they&#39;re searchable, oh yeah, Content within it is searchable. Yep. and they&#39;re accessible because the browser, again, is opening up and then doing all the stuff people are tabbing or need to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; they&#39;re literally perfect for like SEO and hiding content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I use it for transcripts &#39;cause it&#39;s in, it&#39;s right there, but it&#39;s invisible. So the search engine sees it. and, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s, an accordion. It looks like an accordion and it&#39;s the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; same. Yeah, same for this show as well. We&#39;ve got it in there and it&#39;ll stay there. But the interesting thing is we can turn it into an accordion where, what people expect with an accordion is that if you open one, the other one, they&#39;re conscious of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we can do that. We, if we put a named attribute against the details, now it will automatically open one when they&#39;re all the same name. Yeah. They&#39;re getting that grouping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; aspect, aren&#39;t they? I think it is called, isn&#39;t it called grouping or, I can&#39;t remember. But yeah, they&#39;ve got awareness of one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you do this to the third one, the second one will collapse and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. You just put the same name against the name. It&#39;s the name attribute. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Yes, exactly. Against that. And it does it, but it&#39;s really fascinating because I was watching, I&#39;m doing a course Practical Accessibility by Sarah Sara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m saying her surname correctly. She&#39;s brilliant, but she&#39;s just done an update on that one and suddenly you realize we&#39;ll do an episode on this. I think, yeah, you realize that suddenly it&#39;s not as simple as you think. You realize there&#39;s. Accessibility issues with the fact that something closes when something else opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and anyway, we&#39;ll get into that, but there&#39;s also popups as well that we&#39;re seeing, which again, is another pattern that we need to display and hide content and have it show up. I think that&#39;s it Anyway, we&#39;ve gone off into another episode. That&#39;s okay. That&#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean? So all this programmable, flexible stuff there. So I think it&#39;s impacting, as mentioned before, I think hand coders, so I mentioned that Kevin Powell, he did, he got people really upset and he did a talk on it, last year&#39;s. CSS day on over net engineering CSS. And it&#39;s one of the things, and I thought it&#39;s really fascinating, this whole discussion with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He, showed a bit of CSS, which was modern and seemed complex, and people jumped on him saying, this guy&#39;s, a newbie doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. This is, it should be readable. Everything should be readable. And he&#39;s gone to the other view of this, where he agreed with that. Firstly, it should be readable, but I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no longer CSS is no longer just this presentational code where we can just read it and understand what it is. Now, I think we have to accept that if we&#39;re gonna make the most of it, we&#39;re gonna have to put some really complex stuff in. Even when you are using something like grid or something, when you use that RAM technique that talk about repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autofit and MinMax to do a clever calculation, which no one can really remember the syntex to write that out, or it&#39;s a struggle to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but also this is just, how it evolves, isn&#39;t it? Yeah. nobody intended it to be become complicated, but with the expectations of what we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be. if anybody can figure out how to make it and it not be complicated, you, you will, be everybody&#39;s best friend. But it is complicated because, it&#39;s complicated. There&#39;s no, yeah, there&#39;s no way around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think if you can compartmentalize it, and that&#39;s the biggest trouble with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one hand you want to say, oh, &#39;cause having convinced myself that CSS is fundamentally simple, we had a, we had an episode when we were talking about that very point that, Rachel, Andrew and her talk was saying about, you just need to learn this, you don&#39;t need to get carried away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you, and, that is still true, but in terms of employing some of this more programmatic, telling the browser to do really clever stuff, then it gets a bit, it has to get a little bit more mathematical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it&#39;ll be interesting if we end up with kind of a stratified. Workforce in the CSS space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the, there are those, it feels like that. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? there are those people who are kind of entry level, for want of a better word, junior, CSS developers. Yeah. I&#39;m not even there, but, but then you get the more senior, more experienced, engineers. Developers, whatever you want to call them, because it is gonna be more difficult and using the simple stuff will still work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not like you&#39;re gonna break things, it&#39;s just you won&#39;t be able to push the boundaries quite in the same way. Yeah. that&#39;ll be interesting. See if the job market does a, acknowledge that and accommodate that and whether salaries and things like that will be affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I, I&#39;m hoping clever people will keep coming up with recipes for me that I can steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; See, yeah. So you can appear to be clever off the, off on standing on the shoulders of giants. Let&#39;s, exactly. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well, I We covered that in a way, it just realized, I think page builders will always still be there. My little talk that I do for your thing is really the fact that I think there could be, &#39;cause page builders do all that stuff that I get 11 to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need all of that managing of the code, dynamically in certain in places. And I think page builders have always been good at presenting templates and recipes to us in our workflow as we need it. I just think they need to change, yeah, yeah. Yeah. so, my last bit on here was just, again, it&#39;s me comforting myself here, coping with more how to cope, tell me, lie down on the couch, and tell me about your father, how to cope with more complex CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the thing is. I was comforted listening to some real CSS experts. I think on the, YouTube channel, bad at CSS, I think they were talking about this, some people much smarter and been doing it a lot longer than I have. Talking about the fact that they hadn&#39;t got their head around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. This particular thing in CSS, it&#39;s on their list and they&#39;re just dealing with it one at a time. they can still do their job, but it&#39;s more difficult for me because I feel I have to consume it all. &#39;cause I&#39;m just getting back into it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think at the minute you&#39;ve got a really insatiable appetite for this stuff and I think maybe that&#39;s a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that drives your curiosity, which is brilliant, but also it, it presents you with this just wall of things that you have to learn and, you you, forgive yourself, David, be, accepting that wall doesn&#39;t need to be climbed in one go. You&#39;ve got, days and weeks and months ahead,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but it has all come into place for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can blow this apart. please do, but for me now. You&#39;ll remember that I was a big fan of a talk that was on your page Builder Summit by Elizabeth, no. Nora Elizabeth. Laura Elizabeth. Yeah. Yes. That&#39;s it about UX design. And I realized it was a common thread for a lot of people to begin with the content and, then I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use these design rules of proximity spacing. So it&#39;s standard color using some of the rules that you can, anybody can be a designer if you start with that content and think, how I&#39;m gonna use space And that to, set out the hierarchy and the, and what&#39;s important on it. And I think, now we&#39;re being encouraged to intrinsically, or at least think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the browser will deal with your stealth, I think this transfers this sa same idea because you start with HTML content first. That&#39;s semantic. If you think about the content and how it should be marked up and how it might work, you cut out a whole load of the plugging in the, the accessibility and performance issues that created later by ignoring that in the first place, and then you get your messaging right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that whole way of. It connects up to UX design as we should be designing with how, I think we need to design a little bit more in the browser. At least in our minds, we need to know how. Content works in the real world, in the browser in different circumstances before we can get to, sketching it out on something static so we can visually see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think we&#39;re going between the two, but that gives me a sort of system. If I concentrate on those, then I realize that, yeah. Yeah. Stuff that Rachel Andrew was saying about, you really only need to understand well with CSS. You first need to understand how the cascade works and, your elements and how you can style those with the basic rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s simple stuff. Then you just need to learn that these display modes change flow in a different way. Once you&#39;ve grasped that, you&#39;ve got how you can change your layout from the standard normal flow, then you just how you align that and how you size it. Then you&#39;ve got a sort of layout model of which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I think on top of it, and that&#39;s where I, think, I can&#39;t keep up with somebody like Adam Argyle who will spend all of the time working out how to set up these demos and many other people like him. Bra bras, van dams, another person like that who will experiment with absolutely everything. Same as in the accessibility side, the people who sit there and go through all of that saying, How does this read out on Jaws? How does this read out on NVDA? How does this read out on narrator and stuff? They do all of that work and then they come up with formulas for you. So I actually think there will be these high level CSS people, but I think for most of the projects we do. We can, as you say, stand on the shoulders of giants for that, as long as we get the basics in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, and, it does, it feels like the cake analogy comes in. the cake will be tasty because it&#39;s a nicely made cake. But if you want it to look nice and have all the, the, icing as it were, that&#39;s where I&#39;m going with this, the icing on the cake and make it look pretty, then there will be these complicated things that you can leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, would imagine, I could be completely wrong about this, I would imagine most of the clients that you are dealing with. Probably won&#39;t have the, desire to use a lot of those things and nor will you be able to crowbar it unless you become really a adapted it and can do it in a heartbeat. It may not be economically viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. economically viable, Like the time, the cost benefit analysis for you. Okay, can I force these things in? Is it worth forcing in? Is it gonna take me another six hours? Will the budget meet that extra six hours? I think a lot of this stuff is fascinating at the moment and it&#39;ll be interesting to see whether it becomes, widely deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels at the minute as if it&#39;s still a long way off. It&#39;s still in many cases, real edge case. It&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s hard to understand &#39;cause it&#39;s not, I. not the basic stuff that we&#39;re used to, but it&#39;s very exciting. and I would imagine we&#39;ll see the enterprise, the enterprise agencies adopting this and pushing the boundaries and the people who you constantly reference will be using it, creating tutorials, making examples, making component driven, generators and all of those kind of things, which will be fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, suppose if you look through the history of something like CSS tricks. You&#39;ll see an awful lot in there. thousands of articles, most of which probably never got used because by you or me, because they weren&#39;t necessary. They were interesting. and they were pushing the boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, let&#39;s wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Just feel a little bit though. I noticed, but obviously we did these three demos and we&#39;ll do probably more of these in the future. They, were quite easy to do because I was using, a bunch of these generators, basically three sites with the same code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Effectively. Yeah. With these, this generated content that I&#39;ve found, which at least I understand. Stud moved around. That&#39;s basically what those three sites are. So it&#39;s easy to create them and I, but I do think I have to remind myself about this, and I think with all the pressing debates that you get in about, technology&#39;s moving so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually. I think if we step back and just go, what we&#39;re trying to do here, we&#39;re just trying to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Ml exactly. that was where I was going. I was trying to encapsulate that in my sentence, will it assist your communication? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I think you build from there, don&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And that&#39;s why you can do cheap sites for clients, or you can teach somebody to do their own stuff if they wanna improve on it, we just keep doing it and then we borrow from somebody else. And then when you get to a really high level, then you&#39;ll be doing the. Build CSS programming, which I&#39;ll never reach those dizzy heights because my brain doesn&#39;t wear like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, I thought for our content that I wanted to do this episode. &#39;cause I thought what we could try and do a little bit of, &#39;cause we tried to build some sites and then we rushed over explaining. Now that we&#39;re stuck together, I thought what might be nice is to break it up into. a whole series of where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;ll look at the different components, I think, yeah, I think that&#39;s a brilliant idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do one component at a time. Yeah. with a clearly labeled title so that it&#39;s obvious, okay, we&#39;re only doing this thing. that would be great. I think. I think people will enjoy that content a lot. I think that&#39;s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. I think that&#39;s the direction. First we&#39;ll do it, we&#39;ll do an episode where we&#39;ll work out, which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, which, components we actually do need and, and don&#39;t. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. So are we done for this one? I think. I think so. Okay. Enjoyed that. Yeah, that was fabulous. In which case we&#39;re all rectangular again, in which case I will, bid you farewell and we will. We&#39;ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, David. Appreciate it. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. Bye bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should we be offering clients a CMS?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/17/" />
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/17/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We asked our good friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://paullacey.digital/&quot;&gt;Paul Lacey&lt;/a&gt; for his thoughts on offering clients a CMS and to our delight he agree to come on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-cms&quot;&gt;What is a CMS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A Content Management System is software that helps users create, manage, store, and publish digital content.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/content-management-system&quot;&gt;&lt;abr title=&quot;International Business Machines&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/abr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/cite&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&#39;t even consider WordPress a CMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refer to SSG&#39;s and page builders as a CMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the term to indicate a no code way to manage content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we&#39;re focusing on the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-would-we-offer-clients-a-cms&quot;&gt;Why would we offer clients a CMS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s an attractive sales feature?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&#39;ll might hire us to manage it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-would-we-not-offer-clients-a-cms&quot;&gt;Why would we not offer clients a CMS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costly set up, maintenance and support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of training and managing staff changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web content is better handled by web professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-included-in-a-client-cms&quot;&gt;What&#39;s included in a client CMS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to redesign existing pages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add post posts or create landing pages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to only change text and media without altering the HTML?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add software and invite contributors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt; Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show. After a couple of YouTube only episodes, we are back with an audio chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those of you who are watching the video version, you will see that we&#39;ve got the first ever guest for this show. And it&#39;s Paul Lacey. Paul is a good friend of ours from the world of WordPress. He is a UK designer with experience working with agencies and will be able to help us with today&#39;s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that topic is, should we be offering clients, a CMS. A CMS, of course stands for Content Management System. Paul, thanks for joining us. How you doing? I&#39;m doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:39] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; good, thank you. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m gonna help that much though. &#39;cause I&#39;m probably more confused than the two of you. Oh, I think that&#39;s gonna be hard, Tom, but you, yeah, but you&#39;re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do live in the world where this is. This is all going on as such. So I&#39;m in the trenches with WordPress and CMSs and agencies and clients and all that sort of stuff, but I&#39;m utterly confused about it all at the same time about where it&#39;s going and AI and should we be doing this? I&#39;m definitely aware that we&#39;re, that, I mean think actually, I dunno if you know this, but yesterday was the an, the 25th anniversary of the.com boom collapse, when the stock market, collapsed and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then obviously we&#39;ve rebuilt the web from there, but I think we&#39;ve still probably. Started off with some extremely bad habits compared to how the web started and, here we are 25 years later in another existential crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, there certainly gonna be a lot to talk about. I should, before we get stuck into it though, firstly introduce David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you doing, David? Yeah, I&#39;m good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ll just come in and say why Paul is here because I was asking Paul because we know with the, history of the kind of episodes we&#39;ve done here, I&#39;ve, we&#39;ve all worked in WordPress and we still use WordPress, but I&#39;ve recently been trying to play around with static site generators and with WordPress you get this content management system anyway, so why not offer it to clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I, hit a bit of a dilemma because now I started to play with a static site generator. If I wanna offer that same thing to clients, I have to add in. So it&#39;s really made me question again whether I need to. Going forward for my clients or not. So really that&#39;s why I went to Paul, because I know he is really looking after more clients than me and has more experience, particularly with the kind of agencies I&#39;m thinking, should I just drop that all together with the CMSs for me, even though I was a big fan and it&#39;s created a lot of work for me, I&#39;m actually thinking it would be extra work now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I, that was really how you came into it. It&#39;s a, an elaborate ruse really to get you on the show, Paul, but, so I&#39;m pleased it works,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Okay. So yeah, that&#39;s great. Paul, just give us a quick bio actually that would be quite useful. Just tell us what you&#39;re doing currently, even though it might not necessarily overlap with what you&#39;re gonna talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&#39;re in a transition period or something like that, but what are you doing right now? What kind of work do you largely have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:13] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&#39;m probably a relatively typical, Fairly experienced web consultant, working mostly with WordPress, and I used to have an agency, a small one, like five people or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;m now just me prefer it like that. And probably my balance of skills is I&#39;m a jack of all trades as such that I&#39;ll do design work, I&#39;ll do development work, I&#39;ll do consultancy. I don&#39;t do any of the marketing stuff. So none of the SEO, none of the pay per click, none of that sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m all about creating the website. that&#39;s where I come in. And then in terms of my balance of what my work is, I probably, if I break it down by income percentage, for instance, I would say that half of my income is looking after. Around 60 or 70 websites on WordPress care plans and just being like a janitor or a gardener, picking out the weeds for those websites as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d say then another quar, another quarter would be, retainers working for a couple of, different companies. One of them is, beaver Builder, so I help them with design work and some of that sort of stuff. And then probably the final quarter is what would&#39;ve been my a hundred percent, let&#39;s say five years ago, or a bit more, which is, a client comes along and wants a website and then you take them through and they come to you and you are apparently the answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you say, okay, and then, and they give you money and you make website, and then there&#39;s some kind of process that happens in between that is probably completely different depending on who&#39;s doing it and whether it&#39;s an agency or freelancer. What kind of things that agency or freelancer thinks about at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as for me, I&#39;m probably just trying to meet clients where they&#39;re at and trying to help guide them. And if I can see that they&#39;re completely delusional, then I&#39;ll just walk away before the project starts. If I can see that they&#39;re open to, and that, that they, what they want to do is communicate their brand and their product or whatever it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I know I can help them. And I know that it&#39;s probably never gonna be perfect because there&#39;s so many different variables, but I&#39;ll do my best to take them from where they think they want to go and tweak them a little bit as we go along. So I think I&#39;m, o I&#39;m quite good. I think at what I do, I&#39;m not the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I&#39;ve, my heart&#39;s in the right place and I&#39;ve got some skills, so that&#39;s probably where I&#39;m at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Nice. Yeah, this entire chat really is aimed at the building bit. We don&#39;t get into the marketing or the pay click or any of that stuff. It&#39;s all about the, pixels on the page, the HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript, and and interestingly, largely moving away from A CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is an interesting conversation. I guess maybe we should start with the whole, what even is a CMS. that&#39;s obviously a moving target because what was true 10 years ago obviously isn&#39;t true today. But can I just throw that question out there and let&#39;s just see if we can define what a CMS is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;should we, I don&#39;t know. Should I go David first? What do you think? I was just wondering if you should bring up our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; show notes here. &#39;cause we&#39;ve got a, an existing definition on here and I can read that out, which is according to IBM, and this is similar to other definitions. A content management system is software that helps users create, manage, store, and publish digital content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, under that definition, I&#39;d probably call my computer or even my mobile, A CMS, because, it can help me do all those things. That&#39;s true. I think, and I&#39;ve put some things down on the show notes here, is that. Perhaps it depends on the context, which we&#39;re CMS. So I&#39;ve put a note here that some don&#39;t even consider WordPress A CMS because of how, they might compare it to other CMSs that give you more outta the box choices with your custom fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some refer to the thing that I&#39;ve been moving to, which is a static site generator levity in my case, or page builders as a CMS, which I guess they are, under the definition. And I think the one we&#39;re using today, which is what we&#39;re focusing on because we&#39;ve become responsible for it, is, using it to indicate a no code, way to manage content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that we might give to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Okay. Anything to add to that, Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:54] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I think that&#39;s a good definition. Just, it&#39;s just, you can see that. How CMS is, especially this, if we just say a word, a website, CMS, if we narrow it down to that, how there&#39;s been so many different iterations o of that over the last 20 years and you can find a problem with every different concept of how that was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s funny because you can look back and see how certain things were done, let&#39;s say 10 years ago in something like WordPress and think there&#39;s such good aspects of that, but the way that you had to build it was clunky. So that, so it seems that, the focus with the CMS should be content, but in the last 20 years it&#39;s been the CMS is there, but the focus is on code, or the focus is on accessibility, or the focus is on speed, or the focus becomes on design, which is probably where we&#39;re at now, where there&#39;s too much of a design layer in mixed in with it, which is where we&#39;re the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I ask you a question? Just at the start of this. So if you were starting afresh now, in a way, which is what I&#39;m doing now, do you think you would be, if it wasn&#39;t already there in WordPress, do you think you would be offering clients A CMS just off the top of your head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:11] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; so I guess if you could, the question to me, first of all, I&#39;d be a plumber instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good answer. So if you remove the financial aspect, the financial pressure, yeah. Because essentially we are where we are with how, what people want as such. So if I was looking at what people want and I needed to make hay while the sun&#39;s shining, then I would probably do something similar to what I was doing now, if, I was looking ahead, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be focusing much more on the UX side of things, the more human side of things. And I&#39;d be also probably looking at which sectors are, rocky at the moment. So I would, I know what you&#39;ve been doing, David with, static site generations. I really envious that you are able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do feel stuck in WordPress. I&#39;m institutionalized into WordPress, so if I could remove all the baggage, then I would want to reevaluate everything. And I may well come back to WordPress, but probably not for everything. And I would probably be able to, look at it as a tool that did a particular job very well in the right hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it&#39;s definitely hugely problematic. And, the static site generators. To me, it feels like what WordPress was like before page builders without a database, with a CF page builder type scenario and stuff like that. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen from systems like, sta I think it&#39;s called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure about the one that you use, the 11 t. Yeah. And, but yeah, no, I would, I want to do things differently actually. I do want to do things differently now, but it&#39;s so difficult to get out of lane. Yeah. Because there is a constant flow of, and the demand is to do things the way that everybody else is doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what the clients seem to want as well. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; But also, you&#39;ve probably got a heritage of SEO and what have you and You paint yourself into a bit of a corner, don&#39;t you, with all of these things. Yeah. And you&#39;re not always in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:26] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; the driving seat as well. so being a website builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t if you&#39;re a builder or a plumber or a, going back to that sort of trade or an electrician or sparky as they would be called. the plumber comes along and, or the, sparky, the electrician comes along and will point out issues that is wrong with your house that you, that a different person needs to solve, but they&#39;ll just tell you about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas, a builder of a house tends to hire all of those people and pull &#39;em all together and they&#39;re running the show as such. So I find myself a lot of the time in the, I&#39;m, I wasn&#39;t at the beginning of the conversation. I&#39;m brought in and I just need to do the thing that I&#39;m being told to do and then leave, and that&#39;s me done sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s nice when you&#39;re not in that situation and you are leading, somebody comes to you and they&#39;re, ready for a clean slate. They say nothing has worked. And you can say, we do need marketing people, but I can definitely help you get this framework right from the beginning. But I find that to be a rarer, thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that a lot of those people who have that good intent as a client get guled up by a bad agency. So that&#39;s the big problem for me. I think these are just tools that are being completely misused and corrupted. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just interject a couple of things? So the first thing is, your, point Paul, about being slightly jealous of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think David&#39;s managed to unlock some sort of creative future in which he&#39;s not constrained by A CMS. And it doesn&#39;t matter which CMS you&#39;re using, it brings constraints. It&#39;s, it&#39;s got benefits on the one hand and it&#39;s got constraints on the other. And WordPress, just like anything else, will paint you into a corner in certain respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And David&#39;s painting himself in the pixels on a page. Aspect of it. he can put anything anywhere and be led by, Figma can be his best friend. He doesn&#39;t have to worry about, what it will show. He can build that. But also, David, could you just scroll back up a little bit? I want to just address something inside the CMS thing, which I think we missed, which is the, helps users and I think that&#39;s, we&#39;ll come onto it in a minute, why we would use a CMS, but I think that&#39;s one of the big things about it, about using a CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not the managing and storing of data. &#39;cause they all do that. They&#39;ll all store images, they&#39;ll store text, they&#39;ll lay out, with some templating engine, how it looks. But for me. The user bit is the crucial bit. It&#39;s the fact that it comes with all of that built in the authentication layer, the multi users, the permissions and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s one of the crucial bits that kind of o often gets lost. And certainly on this show we ne we never talk about that &#39;cause we&#39;re all about the pixels on the page. But that&#39;s one of the nice things that WordPress brings out the box. Soon as you&#39;ve installed it, you&#39;ve got not the best implementation, but you&#39;ve got a fairly decent implementation of users and permissions and roles and all of that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just wanted to mention that. So with that being said, shall I, move us onto the next thing? So we&#39;ve, I think we&#39;ve explored what A CMS is. We&#39;ve all stated our, case there. And then the next question that we were gonna raise was, why would we even offer it? And I think I&#39;ve maybe just opened the door with that a little bit, talking about, Clients can log in. we&#39;re all familiar with that. Ev every client on earth has used some sort of social network where you go to a login page, you type in your password and username, and you can publish content in that way. And we&#39;re all familiar with that and we can share it and, all of that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe that&#39;s one of the reasons, is that, yeah, I mean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s, whether they need it or not. And I guess this is the question I&#39;ve been asking a lot. I gave it because I needed it personally to manage the content, to create the site as the person building the site and then offering that over to clients is the bit because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know all the bad things that can go wrong. The client, if you&#39;ve set it up in the wrong way, the client can go and break things that can spoil your pay speed. SEO, responsiveness, accessibility can all get out the window. If you set this up wrong. They can even create security risks. They can even run off with something that&#39;s yours, like your licenses and a, WordPress set up and take it or invite other people in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I know all the things here. So it gets me back to that question, we&#39;d offer it because they need it and yeah. I&#39;ve been trying to think out with, most of my clients have come to the conclusion, the ones that I presently got, that not many of them actually need it. If I could offer that service to do the updates on their behalf, that would be a better situation from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Paul, you&#39;ve got wider experience than me with different people, so you might be able to come in with some kind of ideas where people really do need it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:12] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. you&#39;re right. You&#39;re absolutely right that there&#39;s. Like a question, does somebody need it or not? And some of the clients that you&#39;ve got, you&#39;ve right to assume that they don&#39;t and that, the, you&#39;re like a personal trainer nutritionist for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you&#39;re, making sure that their online presence is healthy and you&#39;ve identified that it can live in this kind of sphere where they don&#39;t, need that as such. And I think there&#39;s always gonna be a, segment of the market where that&#39;s the right thing. And the fact that those, if people like yourself can find those clients and give them that correct solution, means that you&#39;re probably saving them like from the next website failure that they were gonna have in WordPress, but let&#39;s say WordPress or something like that, because they didn&#39;t need it, and you guided them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think why would we offer a CMS, so first of all, I think, If we just get rid of like a whole load of market segments in one quick moment, massive blue chip companies will need to manage content. So they have to have CMS, they&#39;ve got, intranets and gigantic websites and multiple people managing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you&#39;ve got a news website like the BBC that clearly needs A-C-A-C-M-S because you&#39;ve got journalists and content creators just publishing content there. And then I think you&#39;ve got the segment that we&#39;re probably all focused on, really, which is the SME small to medium enterprise or SMB, small to medium business, which typical businesses, I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s say anything between one and 200 members of staff, let&#39;s say is a, might come into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is probably where 90% or more of our clients have come from. they&#39;re also the. The clients who are under the most threat, I think, from both sides. So they&#39;re under threat from, let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a company with a hundred people. You are under threat from market disruptors with a, team of five from one side who are extremely agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you also are under threat from the massive corporations who are looking at that. You&#39;ve got, you are making some money and they wanna make that money instead of you. Why? Why should you make that money? They can do it. And so what I wouldn&#39;t really want for that SEC sector who are already under threat as such would be to Have a situation where they can&#39;t communicate anymore. Whereas the Agile people can, because they can hire you David, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and just have you doing their website for them. And then the big corporates, they can spend whatever they like and have huge teams. And then the people in the middle are becoming less agile on the one side and on the other side, they&#39;re less able to communicate without CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to me, kinda and, it, the problem is it&#39;s just been done so badly for that sector. I feel sorry for that sector that, agencies, especially agencies. &#39;cause I see a lot of agencies and I see it, I, and I&#39;ll, talk about this in a minute, just the trend of. Dumbing down what the agency is offering and hiring, very young untrained people who are full of energy, but they are just trying to pay for their car insurance while they&#39;re living with their parents still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they&#39;ll do anything &#39;cause they need that money. But I think that, those SMBs and SMEs in the middle, those are the people who are struggling the most probably to be unique and get their voice out. And the CMS is a way that they can do that on the internet, on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s why they need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I think, as I say, the way that most of, the way that I&#39;m seeing it implemented by agencies and freelancers is super problematic. And then also you get the other side that those SMEs often have kind of dictatorial type CEOs or. Heads of departments who are, even if they got the right person to hire, they decide that they&#39;re gonna power trip that person or that agency and just get them to magpie or copy something that they&#39;ve seen one of their competitors do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have all these terrible forces working against the SMEs, I think. And so I dunno where we go from there, but I think that&#39;s why I think they need them because you can&#39;t, if you take it away from them, then you&#39;ve taken away the opportunity for them to do it. So really I would prefer that they have a CMS, but the entire sector becomes better educated on what, how they should be using that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a tool like WordPress is a design tool and a CMS now. So it&#39;s both, and a lead capture tool. It&#39;s doing everything and, that&#39;s probably where the problem is that I. The, you have lots of smaller agencies as well offering cheap solutions and lying about what the result of using these cheap solutions is gonna be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s, I think it&#39;s, I don&#39;t really like the term disinformation, but I think there&#39;s, it&#39;s, we&#39;re full, of that, that in this sector. Yeah. That&#39;s a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; David, can I ask, because you&#39;ve obviously stepped away from doing a CMS, what are the things that you, that, that have be called your calling into question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;re not moving on to why not to offer, but it&#39;s somewhere in between. what are the things that you, have questioned more recently about the need for A CMS? &#39;cause I know in my case, a lot of the use of A CMS was really. Came down to my convenience. It was a tool that I understood. I could implement it with one click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s hosting companies that you just press one button and look, there&#39;s WordPress. We had amazing tools like, page builders and things, which allowed me to just forget about HDML and CSS and become de-skilled in that way. plugins that whole architecture plugins, that meant that, if it&#39;s been, if it can, be done, probably somebody&#39;s done it and I didn&#39;t have to worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why, are you dissuaded recently? So it&#39;s not the what, why do we not offer it? But just what are the things that you&#39;ve called into Question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s, with a lot of my clients, I&#39;ve never really thought about the process of when the people who are updating the content themselves on their own, that staff changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s usually nothing in place for when that happens. So you might train somebody for the first time to manage their own CMS. But as Paul was talking, I think I need to throw this in. It reminded me that. When I&#39;m saying, not offering clients, a CMS, what&#39;s the reason why we might offer it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, I still am offering them a CMS. So the recent site I&#39;ve done is You are the cms. Yeah. but yes, but actually 11 T has been the cms, which is replicating what I would&#39;ve done in WordPress for a blog. So I have content managed the, layout of their content in an easy way. They&#39;ve got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference in this case is I haven&#39;t given them access to it. You&#39;re the gatekeeper in a No. so in a way, my, my own question is a bit of a silly one because effectively I have given the clients a CMS. What I haven&#39;t done is offer them a no code way to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; There&#39;s no URL where they can log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s more sending David an email with the new content that we want to be. Yeah. So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; have to update it, which is, so yeah, my, I, guess my concern, which I&#39;ll, I mean I did put some bullet points in here is, but that if you are trying to set up a CMS is that, it can be, WordPress makes this easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be costly to set up, and then you have to maintain the thing, which is an extra cost and you have to support it. You have to make sure that it&#39;s updated and secure. And then the issue that I&#39;ve run into before is the kind of extra cost in training somebody to be able to use the CMS that you&#39;ve set up, assuming that we&#39;re setting it up for them to use in a sort of no code way, and then manage those staff changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, this big argument that I&#39;ve seen a lot in the WordPress space recently, which is seems ironic to me, is that argument that is well. you shouldn&#39;t be giving clients any access to WordPress. That&#39;s for you to do. You use it for this one? This would only be handled by web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything going on the web needs somebody who&#39;s trained to understand SEO, the consequences of it to know. And I do think, there is, there&#39;s that fear of dependencies is a reason why not to offer it. You&#39;re dependent on the CMS that you&#39;ve set up. If you can do it yourself manually, but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s definitely a hot topic at the moment, isn&#39;t it? The idea of becoming a professional again, because I wonder if people feel their cake is being eaten by the platform itself, if it&#39;s so easy to use. Why do we need a professional? I, what you&#39;ve done in gatekeeping, your access in that you&#39;ve inoculated yourself from the, the clients basically, they&#39;re either gonna move away from you or keep going with you, and there&#39;s much less, we can do this blog post ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can, add a page here and a page there and what have you. Everything has to go through you. So I think, I know that you are not doing it for those cynical reasons, but I think there is something quite neat about that model. I think it&#39;s quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s one that I&#39;ve still got to test that and that really, because what I&#39;ve had to do is, I&#39;ve had to say in the same way that Paul has already said like 50% of his kind of income is through managing and hosting ing after these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really, that was going to be my passive income. It didn&#39;t turn out to be quite so passive &#39;cause you had to keep updating it all the time. Now what I&#39;m trying to do is, a way of avoid is, some of the issues I have by giving the client a code free access to the website is to say, okay, I still need the retainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still need me to be around. so what I&#39;m gonna do is charge you pretty much the same as what I did if it was WordPress. I don&#39;t have to do the security and the updates that went with it. I don&#39;t have to pay the same for the hosted. So what I&#39;m going to supplement that with is the fact that I will do your updates as part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will go put the code up when you need those updates. But it&#39;s untested at the moment because I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if somebody might just see that as a way of abusing it, and every day they want a new update on their website because I&#39;ve offered this as part of their yearly package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the honest truth from my experience anyway was that most clients that wanted a blog or some kind of functionality like that basically wanted it on paper only. they had this idea that they were gonna write this incredibly influential and powerful blog, and you go back two years later and there&#39;s the first post which was published exactly two years earlier, and then nothing got added in after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. It&#39;s interesting. just on the last bullet point there, you&#39;ve got under the, why would we not offer Clients to CMS? You&#39;ve got fear of dependencies, and we spoke about this in a previous episode. My position was a little bit like, haven&#39;t you just swapped one set of dependencies for another though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of WordPress, you&#39;ve got 11. Exactly. so you&#39;ve not entirely, inoculated yourself against that, but it&#39;s definitely different. No, it&#39;s a different dependency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; in the sense that, Your dependency on something that&#39;s live and dynamic. Yeah. It means that your site can break. Yeah. Where when it&#39;s on a static, it&#39;s, already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if 11 D disappears, actually the site isn&#39;t gonna, the site is still there. That&#39;s a good point. And you&#39;ll just have to replace it. So it&#39;s a site you have lessened your dependency, if you like, or, the impact of having a dependency. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it&#39;s a single dependency as well. Whereas WordPress tends to be a dependency itself and then a series of other dependencies called plugins, which you&#39;ve obviously got to then maintain and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. Interesting trade offs. Are we ready to move on? Are we gonna move on to the, what&#39;s included in a client cs? yeah, that&#39;s, no, I think Paul wants to chime in. No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:29] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; it was just making me think. &#39;cause I, a lot of my clients in that last 25% of work that I do wear is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building websites for people are agencies, but I don&#39;t really have any clients anymore that are a design agency or a web agency. They tend to be a marketing agency. So the website will just be one part of a wider solution. But, so it&#39;s feels like where you put the gatekeeper as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause they tend to be the gatekeeper for their client and they are gatekeeping all aspects of the online stuff. the pay per click, the SEO, the website content, the blogging. So I&#39;m thinking about one particular agency that I do a lot of stuff for, and they tend to roll out the same solution for this particular niche and they will write the blog posts for the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One or two of those clients wanna do it themselves, but it&#39;s rare actually. but they&#39;ll also be doing the SEO quite heavily. They&#39;ll also be doing, analytical things and. Putting kind of popups in different places and then creating sudden out of nowhere, webinar pages or sign up for a brochure pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re constantly creating new landing pages. Not necessarily that they&#39;re doing it particularly like really well. For instance, a lot of the time, like for instance, if they gave me every, and I tend to hand over a, solution to them that they then do that. And I know that when I see them creating the landing pages, in my humble opinion, I could have done the landing pages that they tend to then go after I have left the scene much better than they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s probably, that&#39;s because they&#39;re not, they&#39;re doing everything. They&#39;re doing landing pages, SEO, all sorts of things, and they, just haven&#39;t read, Yakob, Nielsen&#39;s books for instance. They&#39;re literally straight out of college or apprenticeship. Yes. And they&#39;re just learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re just doing what they&#39;re told as such, or copying other things that they&#39;ve seen on the internet. but I, with how you are doing it, David, you become the gatekeeper as such. I know for a fact that wouldn&#39;t work with any of those clients unless there was some change to how it was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the changing of the content is, let&#39;s say just one quarter of the things that they&#39;re managing and they&#39;re doing SEO on the site, they&#39;re doing AdWords, they&#39;re creating, they&#39;re optimizing landing pages to get a better score on the pay per click so that the cost of the pay per click goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s so many different aspects that seem to be, going on a search with some of those, whereas I have other clients that would fit. the concept that you are talking about, David, really perfectly, I even have two clients that I&#39;ve got in my mind that do the same thing. That one would be perfect for how you do it and one would be simply not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s simply because one of those clients has an internal marketing team. And they&#39;re cons and they&#39;re more sales focused, even though they essentially have the same product. The other client has the product but is more of an advocate for the concept of the product. And then so, for instance, I remember years ago Tesco is a, big supermarket and they started selling insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to work for a dog magazine, online dog magazine at the time. This is going back over 20 years. And they wouldn&#39;t advertise in our dog magazine. they were more interested in writing an article for the dog magazine that just, I. Educated con people who had dogs that insurance was a good idea and then they were confident that people would find them as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whereas the other client that I&#39;m talking about that as the marketing person is getting ads here, doing landing pages here and, is just, and, they, and one of those people, pays me 75 pounds a month and the ever pays me 400 and the one who pays me 400 is the one that is doing more stuff themselves that needs me to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. Whereas the other person who&#39;s paying 75 is. Paying for these problems as such, they&#39;re paying for the fact that the website is in WordPress and needs security patches and stuff like that. So that&#39;s in a way where I envy David&#39;s position and think, I wish I could have given them that solution, but I don&#39;t know how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Paul, what you said really, made me think again about the page. So I&#39;m thinking about the pages in its entirety, but you&#39;ve just made me realize that page could have different people who need to be involved in that page, say in the metadata for, for just the SEO or maybe even for adding in ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they need to add because they&#39;ve got some sort of campaign. I haven&#39;t really thought about it. The thing that I. What&#39;s mostly thinking is that even when it comes to a blog post, which is a fairly easy thing to do in say something like WordPress, now as I&#39;ve learned a little bit more about the Semantic web, there are lots of things that can go in that blog post that I would mark up better than the client because it&#39;s just not available to put things in the correct tags, say a blog quote to be in there and the citation under the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those kind of things, even the way that you might, add in numbers or whether you&#39;d use an ordered or a numbered list, all that kind of semantic stuff is stuff that I&#39;ve taken care of. So really, you&#39;ve made me think about, yeah, it probably wouldn&#39;t work even for some of my existing clients for me to say, okay, I&#39;ll do it all for you, because they will just need to be in two different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; aspects of the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you&#39;ve definitely honed down on a type of client that it works for though, haven&#39;t you? Yeah. So it definitely, it works in the scenario that you&#39;ve described, but in the wider world, the scenario that Paul&#39;s describing, I don&#39;t know, SME or something like that. Yeah. It&#39;s not really up for negotiation, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, fact that it&#39;s David, I know. No. Okay. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:16] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it might be solvable. it is just the, tide is so powerful with WordPress at the moment, I think. Yeah. And which might not be the case forever because I. It is WordPress is rather self emulating at the moment to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, how much damage happens from what&#39;s going on with WordPress, is left to be decided as such. But, a few things. First of all, I think looking at the future, the way that I&#39;m describing people want things to be done. I don&#39;t think that is actually sustainable. I don&#39;t think that will survive AI properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think, I, don&#39;t mean like AI building websites. AI being the way that people inquire about information. And when instead of googling now, people will type something into an AI tool and then it will present almost like a custom made. Content, which includes bits of stuff from other people&#39;s websites and citations and videos and that sort of thing, and this kind of total mess of how, let&#39;s say agencies I find are doing it with WordPress where the, all the tools are in that one tool I don&#39;t think will survive because I don&#39;t think that semantically it&#39;s good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And David, what you are talking about when you&#39;ve got these blog posts and that you can properly on behalf of that client semantically structure that in the correct way. And let&#39;s say even tag on to regular editorial, semantically connected advert type things and marketing things that then get pulled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are looking for a new bathroom designer or something, then yes it can then the AI tool in the future might go out and grab that information, about what you want. But it might also semantically know to pull along with it, these particular providers. That have correctly semantically described their tool outside of things like AdWords and Google AdWords and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it is fixable because it&#39;s just a case of it&#39;s, let&#39;s say if we take SEO and doing meta tags and stuff like that, and David, you don&#39;t want to be doing that because some other SEO person is just constantly hassling you every day to change stuff. It surely is fixable that there is some kind of script, an external tool that just gets slotted into the header of the head tag of your static websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he is able to do that as a kind of headless way of injecting a SEO stuff into pages. Yes. Yeah. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a thing. So I don&#39;t think that any of the things that are a concern in the way you are wanting to do it, David, is, not unsolvable. I think the biggest unsolvable part of it is this kind of, the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And but, I think we were talking earlier about just general society before the call about will, at some point everybody say we&#39;ve had enough and we&#39;re pulling ourselves out of the matrix. And I think at some point having seen SME businesses getting, finding it harder and harder to succeed on the internet at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s gonna, that&#39;s gonna implode and get to a point where change is forced and people are saying, why isn&#39;t this working for us? We&#39;re going to an agency. They&#39;re telling us that this is how we should do it, and we are not getting the results we need. What are we doing wrong? And then slowly people will start, realizing that every aspect that, of the thing that this company wants to do online needs to be done much more professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the blog needs to be added professionally. The blog needs to have semantics. The SEO needs to have a proper strategy and that these things shouldn&#39;t be constrained by. They all have to live in WordPress or Jula, or Drupal. They different professionals who are all good at what they do, have their tool that isn&#39;t constrained to one platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s where it has to be in the future. so I think, I wouldn&#39;t say. give up on what you&#39;re doing there because that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying I&#39;m envious that it feels like you are in the right direction. You&#39;re just, and I&#39;ve always felt this way about you, David, that you&#39;ve always been ahead of the curve, even though you won&#39;t perhaps think that you are, whether it&#39;s page builders, genesis in WordPress or something, you&#39;re always, ahead and being a thought leader on these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I see you talking about this stuff, it makes me think I need to listen to what you&#39;re saying because it&#39;ll probably be reality sooner than we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so that&#39;s so kind. I&#39;m sorry. I You&#39;re the right different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:58] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; David. I was thinking of somebody else. Absolutely. I didn&#39;t recognize I was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; questioning every word of that last paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:04] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; you know what I&#39;m saying. Yeah. you are thinking outside the box when people like me are stuck in the trenches and just trying to get some sleep and survive the next day and see whether, see where the direction of travel is, and then aligning myself to that and doing my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are thinking outside the box and you&#39;ve dragged yourself out of that and saying, I, I&#39;m now thinking intellectually about how this should be done. there&#39;s an aspect of your lifestyle that wants to contribute to that as well. But I think you are not constrained in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agency with let&#39;s say 20 staff who&#39;s struggling to, pay the staff bill, they&#39;ve forced themselves into bad practice. unfortunately,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you said something that I thought was fascinating in that really, &#39;cause it just made me think, maybe I&#39;m misreading it, but it sounded like you people needed a content management &#39;cause they needed to keep changing their content because they needed to appease Google and send more traffic to their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you almost get into this cycle. Is that kind of a truth of it? They feel like they need to be constantly changing the content, perhaps more than they actually need to do. If they may be did less of that and did it better, it might be just as successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:21] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s probably also a numbers game to a certain extent that yeah, there is just not enough people with the skills that you will now have to make all the websites that need to be made just in that one sector alone of SMEs, There just simply isn&#39;t the, knowledge and the training. So for the time being, the, while people still want to make a brochure site that is lead generating. the only way to meet that demand is to have people who are semi-skilled, yeah. Taking control of these tools like WordPress and pushing out solutions on mass and trying to make that be done cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wonder, it makes me wonder in the future that this problem gets solved with ai whereby we, where the, this current design layer that we&#39;ve, I think we&#39;re stuck in, we have this design layer, which is page builders have en enabled everybody to be a designer. The products themselves tell the end users that they, Hey, you got this, you can do this, use our templates or, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Then it creates like a false sense of security that this is all doable. And really, this, we&#39;re talking CMS content management system. So I think it has to go back some point to content being the important thing created semantically using, as little dependency, a small amount of security, problems as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that at some point you&#39;ll just use some kind of device to query the internet. And you will need to be able to define that probably through a professional who now is no longer just stuck moving pixels around the screen, but he&#39;s taking an equivalent of a blog post. And let&#39;s move that to a landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take a blog post and move that to a landing page, right? And say, okay, here&#39;s a landing page. here is my most important message. this is the priority of my landing page. And then you are guided through the process of ensuring that you create a semantically correct landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That only has a certain way of presenting itself on the tool that you use to query the internet. So there isn&#39;t any more kind of, should we have a red button or a purple button or something like that? You put the brand JSO file into it. I don&#39;t want to talk, talk like I&#39;m talking about Gutenberg here, there&#39;d be like a brand js o file that these tools have, and then it&#39;ll be a case of semantically presenting your content to something that becomes, again, a content management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem with that is it feels like we are then talking about tools that are created by Facebook and these gigantic, yeah. It&#39;s also, what we probably need in the future, ideally, which is what I imagine that the W three C will be moving or advocating for would be tools that allow you to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content that is static and security doesn&#39;t, isn&#39;t a problem. But somehow that we are encouraged to create this semantic content without the big corporations being the gate, the gatekeepers to that. But the AI tools that are controlled by the gatekeepers and the big corporations are able to query us and whoever does it best, whoever presents their content, whoever manages their content best, ends up being at the top of the ai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queries getting presented to people with products and stuff like that. So I think, content, they say content is king, don&#39;t they? And I think that&#39;s, we&#39;ve lost sight of that. I think most, a lot of my clients have totally lost sight of that. It&#39;s just, I would class it as chaos. It&#39;s king chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s chaos. and you just sit and look at it and think, this doesn&#39;t feel like how we should be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just ask you, &#39;cause I put some notes on here, which just, I&#39;ll just read through them quickly, those listening to it, which is, what&#39;s included in, client CMS is that the ability, as you were mentioning before, to redesign existing pages with say, a page builder, which you&#39;ve got that option now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just the ability to add blog posts and perhaps create a landing page? Is it only to be able to change text and media without altering any of the html? So you&#39;re Actually really nailing that down as you were talking about, And also do we give them access to, they can add in their own software, plugins in the case of, a WordPress or even change the theme or invite extra contributors without it say we&#39;re managing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be a quite a concern if they&#39;re allowed to just invite anybody in. And you don&#39;t, you haven&#39;t vetted them to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:01] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, that, that&#39;s another part of the KSIC all the time. Yeah, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, that&#39;s my experience. it&#39;s quite limited with people who might invite, generally I&#39;m dealing with the business owner directly, but, there are certainly plenty of clients I&#39;ve had and almost anyone who&#39;s got a larger organization, I, I&#39;m suddenly getting an email saying, we&#39;ve got this new user in the WordPress site that I&#39;m still managing, and I think I, I&#39;ve given all these people an admin access so they can give them an admin access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I dunno what that means. Yeah. It&#39;s quite a scary thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. I, how do we feel we&#39;re doing in terms of time? I guess in order for this chat to come to an end, we need to draw a line at some point. Is there any points on that, document that we&#39;re looking at, if you&#39;re watching it on YouTube that we haven&#39;t yet covered off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is there something that we ought to discuss before we wrap it up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve only got one, one thing that&#39;s on my mind, and that&#39;s probably like what I&#39;m scared about and what I&#39;m optimistic about. So I&#39;m scared for my own job in the future with AI and all that sort of stuff. I&#39;m scared for that sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m talking about the SME sector because without them I probably don&#39;t have a job. that&#39;s my, that&#39;s the source of my, pipeline as such, whether it&#39;s direct or through agencies and stuff like that. So that&#39;s, what makes me nervous. And I wasn&#39;t nervous five years ago, but, I see the tools that are out now and I, dunno if I&#39;m nervous because I just can&#39;t see what the future is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing I am optimistic about is that I do think that, that AI will solve a lot of the poor, poor skills in the industry or the bad advice, those sort of things. I think it will. I think that you will need professionals who are more like a orchestra conductor kind of thing. Oh, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like a technologist as such, and, which is what I did at university. My, my university course trained us to be technological managers of anything, whether it was sustainable energy or websites. I went into website stuff. Some of my friends went into different things. But essentially it&#39;s understanding where things are going and then being, a, an advisor and a, kind of guiding light for the people who are downstream of what&#39;s happening as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m exci, I&#39;m excited about a much more semantic web. I&#39;m excited about, getting some of the churn and burn, mindset out of the industry as well. But yeah, I&#39;m definitely nervous for my own, wellbeing. What I&#39;m hoping is that I can. What I&#39;ve always done is, tweak what I do every daily and yearly as such and, see what&#39;s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem I have right now, which I&#39;ve never really had before to this extent, is I really do not know what the future looks like. I, don&#39;t just mean, nuclear war, there&#39;s that obviously as well, but I, honestly can&#39;t fully understand where the web is going. One day I wake up and I think I&#39;ve solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I&#39;ll wake up and I&#39;ve had a terrible dream about it and everything. I&#39;m completely irrelevant. It doesn&#39;t matter, I can just, I guess I can retrain as a plumber, but, as, I&#39;m saying. Those are my fears and, my hopes and fears as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&#39;s a really interesting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think confused. I think everything&#39;s been, yeah, everything&#39;s been driven by humans and they&#39;re such measurable things. Although on mass we can be innovative. The pace of change has been fairly pedestrian. you can, predict largely what&#39;s gonna happen in the next year. I think now in this era of reliance on, let&#39;s just call it ai, basically you speak to a machine and it gives you something back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think we&#39;re in for some seismic change. And also all of us are on the on the, one side of life, let&#39;s put it that way. We&#39;re no longer spring chickens are we, so we have that against it. Probably a good thing. We don&#39;t have to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:16] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; be here for the apocalypse of the That&#39;s right. we,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; bring a different level of experience, but at the same time, we also don&#39;t have that sort of vim and vigor that the, Utes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that I&#39;ve said the word Utes, I think we should probably draw this episode to a close. yeah. do you know, can I just throw in something at the end there? Of course. Just to follow on from Paul, because, I think all the things that you said about me kindly apply to you. It&#39;s just about questioning and, it takes me full circle with this whole thing that we&#39;re doing with the No Script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; We started with a vision of the future for web design that we borrowed from The Talk by Jen Simmons on Intrinsic Design. And I think this is having a big impact. And for those people who like the craftsmanship of web designs, it&#39;s a big change because we&#39;re going from this period where web design has always been about copying what print design did, and then the tools came in to allow us not even to have to deal with the web material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t need to know HD ML and CSS and how browsers worked. And I think what&#39;s. Now happening, and that&#39;s this movement which has started this show, is the fact that we&#39;re moving towards this period where we do need to understand the web. The semantics are important. We actually exclude a whole bunch of people who can&#39;t see the web and the web is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More devices that we get back to the craftsmanship of understanding how the web works and get into HT ML than CSS are fresh because it&#39;s more powerful and more flexible. Than the tools that we previously had. So I think there&#39;s a, my optimism is that changing role, this move to the web being on everything for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that&#39;s a new audience. It can meet people who previously couldn&#39;t access the web in the way that we want them to do, which is similar to print. So yeah, that&#39;s how I tied this up. really agree with that. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:51:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I&#39;m gonna just throw a sort of spanner in the works a little bit there and say that I, have no idea that even websites will be a thing because I, can see a future where the device is just completely just built in order to service you as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you&#39;ll talk to it and it will talk back to you and, when was the last time you sat with somebody that you know closely and per perused together a magazine. you just don&#39;t do that thing. You have a conversation. Can you recommend a plumber? Yeah. What&#39;s their name? Oh, his name&#39;s Pete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s his number? Okay, there&#39;s the number off you go, talk to Pete. That kind of thing. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not entirely sure that the HTML, the CSS, the static screen that we all sit down to, or the thing that we hold in our hand, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s even gonna be the divis of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and when I say I&#39;m not sure, I literally don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not prophesying that I have some insight. It&#39;s that I just don&#39;t know that the flat rectangle that we hold or the flat screen that we stare at, or the TV or whatever it may be, I, don&#39;t even know that&#39;s gonna be the medium that we consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the, yes, Pete future. Pete needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Pete, he&#39;s getting word of mouth, but he needs this C-S-S-H-T-M-L unit, which can go out to the hold of the web in different forms. So he needs us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ll talk to Pete urgently and, can I add one thing? What you said, Nathan? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:36] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I, honestly, one day I wake up and I&#39;m like, we don&#39;t need web websites anymore whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the next day, of course, we need web websites, but I&#39;m wondering if you know what a website just becomes is, because essentially if you look at X ML and HML, it&#39;s structured content. At the end of the day, it&#39;s essentially a static database. So I can&#39;t see a situation where we don&#39;t need a static database of information online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it just so happens that the way that tends to be presented, and I can&#39;t see, I can&#39;t see how it won&#39;t ever be presented in this way, is through HTML and websites. I just think we&#39;ll just go back to what the web started as, but with structured content, and we will still need some presentation layer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just think that the, this kind of very designed website, I. Concept that we&#39;re, we know at the moment will start giving way to this kind of flat database of information structured with HML and XML, with a presentation layer of JS and CSS, so it makes me wonder what point of JavaScripts will be in the future other than, Creating applications that query things. I can&#39;t, it makes you think j JavaScript will be a pointless thing to have on a website because it just needs to be flat information. What&#39;s the point in moving things around? So that&#39;s where I think the websites won&#39;t disappear. They just, we might just not go to them as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might be just pushed to us, but the data is still coming from Yeah. So it&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; more like a repository of data which is presented based upon the thing that you are holding, which is what a content management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:14] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; system is for. Yeah. Yeah. And our,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; job as designers is to make that this static content is presentable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, we give the browser instructions to how to present it to a growing range of different devices. and that job will always be good point with us. And because we&#39;ll always need to, as that changes, new devices come on. And as we need to communicate in different ways with each other, I think there&#39;s a good future for, I think it&#39;s the best time actually at the moment for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are web designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I love these conversations where we get into the more sort of philosophical side of things. It&#39;s really interesting, gazing into the future and just pontificating what it might be. Of course. Who knows? Maybe we&#39;ll turn out to have, yeah. I think anybody who&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; tells you what the future&#39;s gonna be doesn&#39;t clearly know all the variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps we&#39;ll all be shoveling coals into steam. We&#39;ll find out. We&#39;ll find out. Yeah. Yeah. on that bombshell, we&#39;ll wrap this episode up. It just remains for me to obviously say a great big thank you to, to Paul Lacey for joining us today. Who knows, maybe this will be the first of many appearances, but really nice to get your insight into all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, David&#39;s with me every single time. thank you to David as well. Paul. Just before we go, where can people. Get in touch with you, find you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:32] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; please don&#39;t. But if you really must, then you can go to Paul Lacey Digital. and also guys, it&#39;s just been so nice to reconnect. Do you know the, the first ever chat I did before I was in my chating days was with you guys and, so to, to have, years and years of not doing it and then coming back and it&#39;s, you two is just the best, Aw, I wouldn&#39;t wanna do it with anybody else. That&#39;s so nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much. Okay. We&#39;ll be back with another episode at some point in the near future. Until then, stay safe. See you soon. Bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
