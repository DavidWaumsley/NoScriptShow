&lt;h2 id=&quot;forms-expectations-and-clients&quot;&gt;Forms, expectations and clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of heavily marketed no-code products it is not unreasonable for many website clients to think web interactivity is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They may think:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they build it, they will come (the form will itself generate business).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex forms are plug and play and easy to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most are less likely to think about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX and accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the responsivity needed for today&#39;s devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impact on page load and in turn SEO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The potential cost of support and maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As freelancers it&#39;s tempting to buy an off-the-self products to match a clients request. But, if we don&#39;t probe enough we can find ourselves responsible for things we can&#39;t control for clients who can not manage them and were not actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-all-websites-need-a-form&quot;&gt;Do all websites need a form?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only form many personal and small business sites have is a contact form. There’s lots of debate around whether these are needed these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They avoid the spam of a public email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lets you collect structured, required information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can route messages to multiple or specific recipients automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it easier to automate leads into CRMs/databases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardizes subject lines, making inquiries easier to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeps users on the site rather than opening an email client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can log and analyze submissions for tracking and insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Against&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms can still attract spam without proper CAPTCHA or filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users may find forms restrictive compared to writing a direct email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility may suffer if the form is not properly coded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misconfigured forms may fail to deliver messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires technical setup and ongoing maintenance to ensure it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of poor design leading to confusing or frustrating user experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server or plugin vulnerabilities could open security risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting GDPR requirements is more complex with forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If forms are too long or intrusive, visitors may abandon them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contact-us-pages/&quot;&gt;UX experts&lt;/a&gt; say an email  address is a key trust factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/&quot;&gt;Perplexity&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s search of studies concluded contact form convert 3-5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clickable Emails &amp;amp; Phone Number converts up to 38%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website chat converts at 33-50%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WhatsApp message links can achieve click-through rates of 45–60%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A phone number field can lead to a drop in submissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No research over disabled users preferring email or forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I have not included links as the statistics are amalgam or those generated by Perplexity AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certain to be bias, a difference in methods and well, it&#39;s AI!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If accessible, short and the options do not overload the user, a contact form seems a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-our-form-options&quot;&gt;What are our form options?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending form data from a website safely requires us to have a &lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;server&lt;/strong&gt; side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;client-side&lt;/strong&gt; is the HTML the user interacts with. We can think of it as the bouncer on the front door of a night club. They do first checks. We have basic HTML form validation, but presently for accessibility we typically need ARIA and JavaScript to make them fully accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;server-side.&lt;/strong&gt;  acts more like the security guarding the VIP section. It checks the data is safe to allow though and stops the riff-raff (spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-diy-server-and-client-side&quot;&gt;1. DIY server and client side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the HTML, CSS, ARIA and JS we have to manage a self-hosted backend server. Perhaps using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serverless Cloud Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static Site Hosting Plus Separate Backend/API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email-to-Form Solutions via Mail Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-Source Form Server Software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-diy-client-side-with-a-3rd-party-server-side-service&quot;&gt;2. DIY client-side with a 3rd party server-side service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/&quot;&gt;No Script Show&lt;/a&gt; is doing this for our (yet to be improved) contact form. As we are hosted on Nelify we could use their sevice that offers 100 free form submissions per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without adding Cloudflare&#39;s Turnstile CAPTCHA Replacement we were getting about 5 spam emails a day so without this would have used this up. The are presently using Formspark listed below with other similar services:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;From $4.99/month&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-3rd-party-with-a-client-and-server-side-service&quot;&gt;3. 3rd party with a client and server-side service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us this is the most suitable option if we need complex conditional forms for bookings and taking payment. The downside is you lose control over page load UX and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;q&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt; elements, but the specifications have changed over time and don’t entirely line up with our design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Barker&#39;s article &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-irl.info/ive-been-doing-blockquotes-wrong/&quot;&gt;I’ve Been Doing Blockquotes Wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; highlights how difficult HTML can be at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official HTML specifications are with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). This tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quote elements are for &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element&quot;&gt;external sources&lt;/a&gt; only. Presumably to the page rather than the domain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cite &lt;strong&gt;attribute&lt;/strong&gt; is used to specify a URL source. This is invisible to humans and most screen readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The visible cite &lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt; is for the title of a creative work only and should not be included in the quote element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blockquote is a sectioning &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;. It marks a distinct part of the content, but not part of document&#39;s outline as with sectioning &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; (such as aside, article, nav).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should not use quotation elements for (self quoting) pull quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should not use cite elements for authors of quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The citation is orphaned from the quote. Not ideal accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s hard to find consistent advice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/&quot;&gt;expert sources&lt;/a&gt; have encouraged us to use blockquotes in ways that seem technically incorrect including &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/quote-block/#insert-your-quote&quot;&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/coding-blockquotes/&quot;&gt;code example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heydonworks.com/article/the-blockquote-element/&quot;&gt;Haydon Pickering &lt;/a&gt; suggests placing blockquotes and cites within &amp;lt;figure&amp;gt; and  &amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Roselli recommends against using figure as it&#39;s verbose for popular screen readers. However, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://adrianroselli.com/2023/07/blockquotes-in-screen-readers.html#Example07&quot;&gt;preferred approach&lt;/a&gt; breaks WHATWG rules as he uses cite within the blockquote and uses them for authors too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.w3.org/components/quote.html&quot;&gt;W3C design system&lt;/a&gt; uses a &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt; element to cite an author Unlike Adrian Roselli, they do not use the cite element because of the WHATWG specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design systems for local governments reveal many other variations. Probably due to changes in the original W3C documentation that was not carried forward to WHATWG. The W3C essentially defers to WHATWG&#39;s HTML Living Standard as the authoritative specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-approach-to-the-html&quot;&gt;Our approach to the HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have the standing to influence specifications like Haydon Pickering, Adrian Roselli or Michelle Barker so we&#39;ll stick to  WHATWG rules to be consistent from here on (until told otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;testimonials&quot;&gt;Testimonials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical pattern is the external quote followed by the author&#39;s name sometimes with a link to their organisation and image of them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://band.here24.co/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we will use the W3C design systems approach of not using cite, but putting the author credentials in a footer element within the block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a URL we will add the invisible cite attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the testimonial contains a heading the markup would change depending on whether the heading was part of the original quote. If it was, we would add the heading as part of the quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, we&#39;d use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; as below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Review Title&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;blockquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The review content...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Reviewer Name&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;blockquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 A blog entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pull-quotes&quot;&gt;Pull quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element&quot;&gt;WHATWG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;blockquote&gt;
   The aside element can be used for typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Keith set off debate in 2016 by asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/11102&quot;&gt;Why do pull quotes exist on the web?&lt;/a&gt; It&#39;s a great question given it is a duplication of content that visually does not look impressive on small devices. It is also not easy to code with many employing JavaScript to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;regular-quotes&quot;&gt;Regular quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep things easier for both sighted and non-sighted users it seem to make sense to cite before the quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In NAME&#39;s article/song/presentation
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;cite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https:/www.example/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;NAME OF THE WORK
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;cite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
s/he says:
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;blockquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 THE QUOTE
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;blockquote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-or-inline-quotes&quot;&gt;Block or inline quotes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heydonworks.com/article/the-blockquote-element/&quot;&gt;Haydon Pickering &lt;/a&gt; points out that the term “block quotation” precedes the blockquote element. The Chicago Manual Of Style recommends block quotations are over 100 words. Some examples in the specification have very short quotes and so it remains unclear when (semantically) you should use one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show. This is the fourth in our series, looking at components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re looking at testimonials, block quotes, pull quotes, and the site elements and how these are most likely coded wrongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other episodes in this series, we&#39;ll be considering these from a technical design, accessibility, and SEO perspective, and we&#39;ll follow up this chat with a YouTube video looking at some coded examples. This time it is slightly different in that we will be focusing on the HT RL markup in this podcast, as there is a surprising amount to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And CSS styling is what we&#39;ll cover in the follow up video only content. As always Joined by David Wamsley, who&#39;s over there? Hello, David? Hello? Hello? Nathan Wrigley. You&#39;re sporting a slightly different background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I&#39;m in London, usually I&#39;m in India. but we&#39;re a bit closer. We were almost close actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. we nearly got to see each other. Yeah. It all happened in this time, but yes. anyway, let me move on to this. &#39;cause you were the one who really set me off on doing this topic a bit earlier. We would&#39;ve done it anyway because you shared with me a video by Kevin Powell, called is HTML the Hardest Language, and he was demonstrating with his, followers and everything, how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone, he gave them a card component to code up and everybody did it in slightly different ways, which really asked you that&#39;s what is the semantic way. And this really reminded me of a post by or series by Hayden Pickering where he is looking at various, has HTML elements and. It really highlights the fact that there&#39;s a lot of confusion on how to do HTML and it really caught my attention, the block quote one that he did and the site element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it set me off experimenting about, how, &#39;cause we&#39;re trying to set up our own, if you like, design system and have a consistent way of marking things up. And yeah. So I went on a bit of a journey. Yeah, sorry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; about that. All of that. With me DMing you on blue sky and set you off on a complete, laundry list of things to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apologies about that, but hopefully there&#39;s some useful content in here. Should we switch to your screen? Do you wanna do that one? Yeah, let&#39;s do that. Okay. We&#39;ve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; got a lot of notes to get through actually here. I&#39;d be largely reading these out I think, &#39;cause the research has been done. Yep. So let&#39;s talk about, so we called this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&#39;t quote us on this, or I should mention as well. I&#39;ll put a little note. It actually is already in there that another reason for doing this is that the state of HTML 2025 is still open as a survey. I, haven&#39;t done it myself, but I will. No, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; took a quick look at it. I didn&#39;t fill it out, but I will come back and fill it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not a long enterprise, it&#39;s fairly quick, but, obviously somebody somewhere needs to know where we&#39;re all at. and yeah. Useful to fill out. I would&#39;ve thought so. We&#39;ll provide the link in the show notes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s down there in my. So for those who are on YouTube, you will be able to follow along with our notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I put first where we quote, where we use quotes. So in testimonials for credibility and social proof, we use, in blog comments for engagement, effectively where user submissions are a quote Yeah. Of some form. Yep. in pull quotes for style and highlighting. I&#39;m not sure. do you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say pull quotes, does that mean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anything to you? Do you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; have an expectation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I&#39;m, basically imagining the, things that you&#39;ve described previously. So to me, a pull quote is a block quote. I, genuinely wouldn&#39;t have known what the difference was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s all, it&#39;s just interesting. We&#39;ll, move on to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause there&#39;s an article by Andy Clark where his interpretation of a poll quote is different to what I think, I&#39;m talking about here. But generally it&#39;s a self quote, I think, where we put it. Usually in an article where there&#39;s this big thing that gives you a, some styling, it gives you some highlight of text that&#39;s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s a, okay. It&#39;s duplicate content. and we use it in articles, for, oh, I&#39;ve made a. To support our arguments. Okay. often,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s fairly widely used throughout the web. I think the, place that I see it most is, comments on blogs and things like that are out of fashion, aren&#39;t they these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I see it all over on testimonials. you, somehow want to, I don&#39;t know, link the words to the image or the person&#39;s name or something. And in order to do that, you adopt this different style and maybe some iconography around it. And,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Yeah, exactly. this is the interesting bit really of what we&#39;re gonna get stuck on, the difficulties with Symantec HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the block quote element, the Q element for inline quotations. We have the site element, which Haydon Pickering says really ought to be called citation rather than site, but, But the thing is with this, the specifications have changed over time and they don&#39;t entirely line up with the design patterns that we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after reading Haydon Pickering&#39;s article, I also stumbled across Michelle Barker&#39;s article, which says what exactly what I experienced. I&#39;ve been doing block quotes wrong. Through, listening to or reading his article, she realized that, and I&#39;ve got it up over here. And there was quite a lot of, and this has helped me look into this more because there&#39;s a lot of comments here on that by some really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quite clever people. She&#39;s a very clever person as well. She writes some of the M dms, we&#39;ve mentioned her before. Yeah. Articles and, that was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; me saying comments or dad and Yeah. No, there&#39;s a load here. I, on this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; topic. I think it&#39;s particularly popular. Yeah. and also she&#39;s actually using eleventy as well on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, interesting. Add in our comments myself. Yeah. yeah, so that was quite interesting. But the, I think the, a lot of the changes due to the fact that the official HCML specifications are with the web hypertext, applications, technology working group. Easy for you to say no. What w what? What wg, I think, &#39;cause it&#39;s, the working group, so we&#39;ll call it what, I dunno how people say it, but we&#39;ll say what working group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s be easy. So what they tell us through their documentation, which I&#39;ve got over here, is go back that quote elements are for external sources. Oh, so we should only be, so if we&#39;re using those, if we&#39;re using a block quote, it should be for someone else&#39;s comment, not our own, but presumably, because it&#39;s not spelt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to the page, at the page level rather than the domain level. But. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s unclear. Okay. the site attribute, attribute being the site equals quotation mark should be where you put a URL to that source of the quote. Okay. Okay. And it&#39;s invisible to humans and most screen readers, but the visible site element, the, one, the actual tag itself is for the title of Creative Works only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it, and there&#39;s another element of this, that the site element shouldn&#39;t be included in the quote element, so it shouldn&#39;t be within the tags of our block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So there&#39;s a lot more depth to this than I imagined. That&#39;s yes. rules upon rules, not rules as such recommendations, But nevertheless, I did not know that there was that level of granularity, so that&#39;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It is, and it&#39;s also quite confusing as well because it&#39;s some of this comes in, so this idea that it&#39;s only for the title of Creative Works only rather than an author comes only after HTML five. I know that&#39;s been around for a long time, so there has been changes over time and it&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputed. I, think Jeremy Keith is one person who was trying to argue against that at the time. anyway, I&#39;m going into things that we don&#39;t need to, and the last point that I got here is that the block quote is a section in route, so it marks a distinct. Of content, but is not part of the documents outlined in the way that section elements such as side or article or Nava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with screen readers, they will be able to look at different makeup of a page or something by looking to those section elements, but it is still something distinct. What I wrote down here is that it means that we should not use quotation elements for self quoting, pull quotes, and that&#39;s what I generally think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pull quote is something where you are referencing something within your own document to stylize it and say, here&#39;s a bit of a teaser of what&#39;s to come. So we shouldn&#39;t be using, the block quote tag really for our pulled quotes. we shouldn&#39;t use the site element for authors of quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last point on is that citations are, or orphaned from the quote, which is not ideal for accessibility because again, it&#39;s Haydon Pickering, it picks up on how uncomfortable that is because it&#39;s a little bit, I think he does make this example, but it&#39;s a little bit like how, if you. Have on a blog archive page, these read more buttons that you have, which are separate to, or links separate to the description, then it&#39;s very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not, It&#39;s not, yeah, it&#39;s outta context with it. So I think that&#39;s a similar thing happening, but really that&#39;s what we&#39;re encouraged to do if we go with What wg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; have you managed to memorize that in your head now, such that if you were just writing out HTML and you were trying to deploy citations, block quotes and so on, have you got that cascade of things figured out or would you have to go back to that and say, which example does it fit into here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve got it sorted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; out now. Yeah. But that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do for this one. We can have something is, is the no script shows way of doing it, I think. But this is the next thing. I&#39;ve put it on my notes here that, this is where it gets really difficult &#39;cause it&#39;s hard to find consistent advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have. Many expert sources and I&#39;ve only actually put one in here and that is, lemme just go back here, is the HTML five doctor, which is supposed to be the place to really get, to learn all your stuff. it says different things Wow. To watch. Yeah. so that becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also have, as well, with WordPress as well, it is quite interesting because if we go to. press.com and it looks at it&#39;s, quote block there. So it works against it as well, because what it literally says is that you can use this, it will add in your citation will be the author, and there&#39;s nothing on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the citation was in with the block quote. So technically according to what wg Yeah, what WordPress does on there. And there&#39;s a code example on here. it calls no problems for. and this will make sense for, there&#39;s an article here looking up the Block quotes by Amber Hines, who&#39;s a big accessibility person in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she sees no issue with how that does it. He thinks she&#39;s doing it semantic, and I think you&#39;ll understand why she doesn&#39;t see an issue with this one. Yeah, maybe she&#39;s not looked into it, but let&#39;s have a look. if we go here. So there is that side of it. So technically these. Experts there, and this platform is wrong according to the present specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also when we start to get to experts like Haydon Pickering in his article, what he suggests is a get around the fact with, lemme just go to his posts for those who can see, that one. Yeah. Yeah. So in terms of accessibility as a problem with the idea that you would put the citation. Separate to the quote, because it&#39;s not programably linked together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Yep. So his way around this is to put everything in a figure. So you have a figure. Then a block quote, and then you have a fig caption, which contains your citation within there. Citations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So that&#39;s his approach. However, then we come to Adrian Ly, who&#39;s one of the big players when it comes to accessibility, who&#39;s gone and tested all the different ways that a screen reader will read these different ways of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, interesting. Okay. Yep. Yeah. So his own approach is to not do that. What he recommends is because it&#39;s so verbose for screen readers, all the popular ones to read out, fig not to do that. Yeah. So he goes with block quote, and then he puts in a footer where he puts his citation and then closes the, block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So that&#39;s his way as an accessibility expert who doesn&#39;t, let me say that all of these people say this is how they&#39;ve dealt with the situation. Not necessarily this is the way to do it. I don&#39;t think anybody feels confident in what rules we have at the moment, so, anyway, you could see a contradiction there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can go two different routes on that. And let&#39;s see, gosh, what, it&#39;s really surprising. Open a hole. Disagree. I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Isn&#39;t as fascinating. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think attention&#39;s going to H-D-M-L-A lot more at the moment. it&#39;s been on CSS, but yeah. But I think we need to get these fundamentals right. And finally, the one that I think we are effectively going to use is the W three C design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I just move on to this one, so it&#39;s similar to Adrian ly in the sense that there&#39;s no fig with this one. It&#39;s put in a block quote. Then it&#39;s adding a footer. Yeah. &#39;cause this is a section in route. It&#39;s perfectly fine to add in a footer element and, ending it with a block quote. So if you like, but what they, and they point out in the considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point out the fact that, and this is really where it all goes wrong, there&#39;s been some leniency when HTML was decided by the W three C itself on their own documentation. But since. I think 2019, this has gone to the Living Standards Working Group, which is the what wg. And not everything that has been changed there has transferred over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our official documentations may not be up to speed, if you like. This is where we get some of the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say officially then. It&#39;s really confusing officially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s confusing. Officially. It&#39;s confusing. Yeah. Yeah. When you&#39;ve got brilliant experts like that, but I think. I think the way for us to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and again, I went and had a little search around just what people did well, interestingly enough to search around what some of the people say they do and what they actually do as well doesn&#39;t always match. So they&#39;ve changed. Okay. They&#39;ve changed over time. Like we, we will be changing over time and when we go and look round, there&#39;s not much in the way of the big design systems out there for this specifically, but there is a lot of sort of local government, Design systems out there. So if you go and look at them again, they&#39;re all different variations. Gosh. Yeah. It&#39;s a, spaghetti, isn&#39;t it? It is. And yeah, I, just think it is due to this. And in fact, there&#39;s a point that was made on Michelle Barker&#39;s, I&#39;ve been doing. Block quotes wrong. I think the last quote on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. This is by Amelia Bellamy Rhodes, and I know of her, she&#39;s on the working group for SVGs, I think so I&#39;ve seen her name for this one, and that&#39;s it. How she&#39;s spelling it out how the three C spec was modified. If you allow two. Be a little bit more flexible to do what Jeremy Keith, I think years back wanted to do to be able to contain authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I was pointing out that sort of WordPresses basically got it wrong in terms of the official spec, you can understand why it&#39;s like that? Yeah, because, We were generally leaning towards that, although I think, it would be better if it did have a little footer to separate the citation within the block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, so that&#39;s really, I think, what we&#39;ll do, I think as we don&#39;t have the kind of standing and influence like people like Adrian Rosalli, Haydon Pickering, or Michelle Barker. I think we&#39;ll try and stick to the what WG rules. Okay. Just to get some consistency. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And, until we&#39;re told otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yeah. Until they&#39;ve finished that bun fight and, sorted it out, frankly. Yeah. Okay. Testimonials now then, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So, rationalizing the code, so this took me some time to kinda work out, so exactly how we&#39;re laying things out. So a typical pattern, and I&#39;ve got an example up here. On that sort of little demo site I made first, which we&#39;ll use at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical pattern for a testimonial might be something where we have what someone said about us, maybe a picture of the author and their name, and maybe a link to their organization. Or one of the other. and that&#39;s a sort of common pattern here, That would be straightforward. What we&#39;re doing here with something like that is that we&#39;d be putting it all in a block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. And using W three Cs and putting all of the stuff where their names, their image, their where they work, or their company or their t yeah. We would all go in that footer within a block quote, so that would be fine. there is the circumstance where. Sometimes you see with these, this pattern, you will see a header as well as the quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes, there&#39;s just a sort of summary of what the quotation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; says. Oh, interesting. I&#39;m trying to remember when I&#39;ve seen that, but I, can&#39;t conjure it up. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think sometimes if you&#39;re taking from a source, that does that some, reviews do allow you to put the title and then like a name, like a too long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; didn&#39;t read kind of thing where you summarize the quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that what you mean? Yeah. You might just, Yeah. Like, stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; then the quote, which is, yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Got it. they might just pull out the main, because we know people read titles and some of the review, things are set up, which is another point actually I should mention really. &#39;cause, just thinking about the SEO perspective on this one, when it comes to testimonials, we can&#39;t really use, that review markup, the rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text or the schema for that one because it can&#39;t be self-serving, so we can&#39;t say something. You can&#39;t use other people&#39;s quotes about us. yeah. To self serve. So for testimonials that, that doesn&#39;t become an issue. Anyway, thi this did make me think about that pattern. So if it was a pattern where, the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Header was part of the quote that was submitted by the user. Then I would just put a header three probably that would be the likely one, and then it would be the block quote. Okay. In the block quote, itself. Got it. but if it was one where we decided to sum up their block quote, then what I would do is wrap the whole thing in an article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Yeah. Again, this is another one where it&#39;s another Hayden Pickering, topic where he talks about article, and I think it&#39;s from him that I got this idea. &#39;cause when I thought of article as a tag, I tended to think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; of just blog posts. Yeah. that&#39;s where my head goes. It, doesn&#39;t, in my head, it doesn&#39;t land as a container for more broad stuff, even though I know it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think if we look at the actual spec for it, I won&#39;t pull it up here at the moment, but it actually says it&#39;s any sort of standalone element that you could use on its own. Yeah. So an article would be right for this, and I think it was Haydon Pickering or something. It said, is, and I think this is that way of looking at it, and now I think of it as like an article of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, interesting. Okay. You do you know what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean? It&#39;s like a pair of gloves or something. They stand aside, but they&#39;re not the entire thing. And, because we can use, yeah, because I think it&#39;s any sort of standalone. So I think it would be suitable. So that would be the semantic way. And I&#39;ve put the code here, sorry for those who are just listening, but basically it would be the surrounding, wrapper, if you like, would be the article tag within that, then I&#39;d put our header, Because we&#39;re making that up ourselves in that would be the block quote with its footer, with the reviewer&#39;s name, and then it would close with the block quote, and then finally the article wrapper so that you got article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with. Children of a heading and a block quote. And then inside the block quote, you&#39;ve got your content paragraph, footer and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. Okay. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I was wondering about comments as well. not that we&#39;ve got them, but we&#39;re gonna have to get like blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; posts, that kind of thing. Yeah. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; when we&#39;re inviting people to use a generated what, where they would fit in, and I think the official specification tells us this, what we can use, and that is a blog entry on a, this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting from them, a blog entry on a site that accepts user submitted comments could be represented as could, sorry, could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry. So I wouldn&#39;t be using blog quotes for that kind of quoting, and we would just stick them in nested articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you&#39;d have articles nested within articles. Within, an article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yeah. So I think that&#39;s how, it is interesting because I think later we&#39;ll try and put some form of commenting system on our own, site. So I think, it&#39;s interesting to see,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Especially given the user submitted nature of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously with modern CMSs, you&#39;ve got the capacity to, put things into a pending state, so they don&#39;t make it there. But if you&#39;re worried about SEO and things like that, then. User submitted content might really run against what you&#39;re trying to do, or I don&#39;t know, mention your commercial rivals with links and things like that, so there may be something there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I did look, Michelle Barkers, I, because I was there, I thought I&#39;d poke around at the code there and I noticed that her articles, which obviously she said to create the whole HTML for that one, we put in a block quote, which is seems appropriate. For it. but when you think about it, people just shove all sorts of stuff in there, which isn&#39;t necessarily a quote that might be quoting somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&#39;t fit the quote. So I actually think, and, when I looked at examples of at least classic WordPress sites that I&#39;ve seen, I think most people have marked it up in the way that, what WG would suggested by using the Raptors articles in the, okay. Okay. So I think that&#39;s what we would do in that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pull quotes, Again, we&#39;ve, what WG has given us, and I&#39;m quoting here, is the aside element can be used for typographical effects, pull quotes or sidebars. So it literally mentions where we can use the aside. so as a sidebar,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the aside being a side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; because they&#39;ve spec specified pull quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you like Paul quote, is that duplicate of content that we put on somewhere in style separately? It&#39;s an aside to our main article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, that&#39;s pull quote. Is it? &#39;cause at the beginning we talked about, so a pull quote is where you. You literally are pulling something out of the article. It&#39;s duplicate from an SEO point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. But you wanna highlight it. So it&#39;s like when you&#39;re reading a newspaper sometimes, or a magazine, sometimes they&#39;ll just, I, don&#39;t know. It&#39;s eye catching, isn&#39;t it? They&#39;ll throw that, that one sentence, which kind of encapsulates the next two paragraphs. Yes. As a, as an easy way. It&#39;s almost like a heading, it&#39;s navigates you into what&#39;s coming or what has just been said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Okay. Okay. I didn&#39;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So block quote isn&#39;t appropriate. No. that&#39;s what people have used of course, because of the confusion. But an aside seems to be the thing to do. no one really knows, but that seems the most. But there is an interesting debate that goes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Keefe set one off in 2016, got tons and tons of comments, asking the question, why do Paul quotes exist on the web? And it is a great question given that if your screen reader. And in his own post, it gives that example, if he was to read it with a screen reader, it&#39;s terrible because it&#39;s got this pull quote out and then it repeats the next thing you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. You&#39;re just hearing this constant re repetition. Yeah. With no visual clues to know what the heck is going on. Why is this article repeating itself? So there&#39;s that difficulty. There&#39;s the difficulty. Some people, although I don&#39;t think duplicate content is an issue for SEO, but some people have been conscious about that, but also, you do all this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pull quotes. Generally they are pulling slightly out of the main body of content. You mean physically? they look, yeah. Physically. They usually pull to one side left. Yeah, Do that to the main content. Yeah. If you&#39;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; a left to right reader, then it&#39;s slightly to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And they&#39;re really, difficult to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll move on to that when we talk about CSS, but, a lot of people have had to employ JavaScript in order to make this thing that&#39;s outta the main body. Move to where you want it to do, and then it doesn&#39;t look all that impressive necessarily when you get down to smaller devices where you can&#39;t see that it&#39;s pulling out you, you&#39;ve literally only got the room for your text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So yeah, so there is that. and, what did I put here for regular quotes? Okay. So our format, in. unless you disagree on any of these ones, I think to keep things easier for cited and non-sighted users, not non-sighted, as I&#39;ve written here,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it, seems, I&#39;ll put an s in there later to make sense to cite before the quote. So I think when we&#39;re doing our articles, generally it&#39;s better to you&#39;ll have your paragraph that will be running, you&#39;ll put the name of the order. Author and then, reference their article, song, presentation, whatever it is, as the title of the work, with a link to that one, and that will be in the citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then. he or she says, and then it will just be in the block quote doing it that way. So if you are put in as, I think most people when they were thinking about HTML spec, were thinking when you use a block quote, you&#39;re quoting generally, you might introduce it first. Yeah. Before you do the block quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in. General, general blog posts. That would be my format. I think so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess it&#39;s almost serving as a little signpost of Okay. This is why it&#39;s now, okay. It is out of the flow of the normal text, but here&#39;s a, flag saying this is what it is. This is, as you&#39;ve written there, the name of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s like a mini title. It&#39;s alerting you to here&#39;s something different. Yes. Then the quote comes afterwards where if you had it the other way around. the site. At the end of it, after the block quote, then it would just go straight into that. It would feel like an ordinary part of text and then the name of the title would randomly come and you wouldn&#39;t know where that started or stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Yeah. That&#39;s interesting. And I think that&#39;s presentation. you often see it. Differently, don&#39;t you? You&#39;d see the, you&#39;d see the quote first encapsulated in some container, which is, I don&#39;t know, a rectangle or something to differentiate it. Different color background or something. Then the person, let&#39;s go for person&#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no. The name of the work might be at the bottom. In an old font or something like that. And, you can capture that &#39;cause you can see it all. But if you&#39;re doing it. With a screen reader that&#39;s all back to front. &#39;cause you need that indication at the beginning. Okay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think the pattern&#39;s different and I think most of the haste, this is my understanding of it, is that the, when writing out the spec there, they&#39;ve generally been thinking of written text and articles where you might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;ll introduce as part of your copy who the author and what work it&#39;s citing before you move to the block quote where it all gets thrown out. And we get into trouble is when we start to think about this design pattern of the testimonial, where we tend to put the quote up front. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the author after, and it doesn&#39;t work anyway, I think we&#39;ve solved that. Yeah, there is, another interesting point again from Hayden Pickering on his article, and that is, when you use the, we&#39;ve been talking about block quote all the time, but there&#39;s the, there&#39;s the Q tag, the inline, quote and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reading the notes here, I will correct these later &#39;cause it says it&#39;s okay. yeah. He points out the, fact that, the term block quotation precedes the block quote element ever existing in HTML and the Chicago Manual of Style recommends that a block quotation is over a hundred words. There are some examples as he points out in the specifications, which have very short quotes and they use block quotes. So it still remains quite unclear when at least semantically you should be using block quote over the queue. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s a visual thing in the end, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ends up you say block quote because it&#39;s basically. Style wise, it&#39;s taken up the whole block where it&#39;s not in line. But, semantically, I don&#39;t know. There isn&#39;t any clear guidance on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Which you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No. Interesting that, we reference things like the Chicago Manual of style. I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s Hayden. No, but just the fact that there. A Chicago manual of style. I think I need that in my life. I don&#39;t have enough style basically, and it&#39;s got to be over a hundred words. Oh, fascinating. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright. Yeah, so I, anyway, I guess that&#39;s this, our aim of our show was to try and simplify things and I think I&#39;ve just made things as about as complex as they, no, you highlighted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; complexity that all of us have ignored, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we, I think it would&#39;ve been fair to say that most of that, nobody&#39;s pricing off the. The lid to appear inside that jar just because you rely on, especially in the WordPress world, you rely on a block increasingly to just take this work for you. Yes, you put a block, quote, block in, and you assume it&#39;s doing everything correctly, whereas in fact, perhaps you need to roll your own or certainly be thinking about the context in which you&#39;re using it, be it a block quote, a quote, a testimonial, a citation, whatever it may, be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot more to it, honestly. Way more to that than I thought, so that&#39;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I would be really interested, if anybody does have any thoughts or, they spot anything that I&#39;ve completely missed on this or want to change our mind, then I&#39;d love to hear on that one. But I think what we&#39;ve decided to do on this as a design system sort to make sense &#39;cause we&#39;re not, breaking any rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the interesting thing is about the site element. It really, it doesn&#39;t seem to have any purpose. It&#39;s there for semantics. Yeah. But it&#39;s not read out by screen readers. Certainly, when we&#39;re using that as the attribute, nobody sees it. So what&#39;s it? Therefore it&#39;s, the, full use of this isn&#39;t in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps one day if we all do the right thing, maybe it might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there any more on that, page that you want to go? No. You just got some links there at the bottom, styling quotes, part two and what have you. So are we. Are we a wrap? Wrap? Wrap? It&#39;s a wrap. Wrap as they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We&#39;ll just move&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; on. And this will be quick, I think, just part two because we&#39;ve talked all about the HTML and said, we&#39;ll just quickly talk about how we might. Go about styling some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so in which case, if you want to follow along with the show notes that David&#39;s been displaying there, including typographical corrections, you can go and find those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then head to no script show. And then this episode is 24 so slash 24, the numerals two four. Go and check that out. And then there will be a corresponding episode in which, this is demonstrated. David gives it a bash, and that is no script show slash learn. 15 1 5. So those two things will correspond and overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we will, see you then. So shall I, shall I, hit stop on this recording and yeah, we&#39;ll go into the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, see you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Nathan. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Styling Quotes with CSS</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/15/" />
    <updated>2025-08-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/15/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/24/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; we attempted to rationalize the HTML mark-up needed for testimonials, regular quotes and pull quotes. Here we are looking quickly at styling them with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;testimonials&quot;&gt;Testimonials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s common for these to be displayed as a carousel, but until this can be achieved in an accessible way without JavaScript we (for reasons associated with the show&#39;s name) look for simpler and more resilient options like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Reel&amp;quot; a horizontal scrolling technique used on &lt;a href=&quot;https://every-layout.dev/&quot;&gt;Every Layout &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; as used on our demo &lt;a href=&quot;https://band.here24.co/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a 3 column testimonial can be found on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/testimonials/&quot;&gt;intrinsic framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details and summary used on the band website demo combines the RAM technique &lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/maximum-column-grid/&quot;&gt;shown here&lt;/a&gt; with the disclosure widget example &lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/disclosure-widget/&quot;&gt;shown here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pull-quotes&quot;&gt;Pull Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/24/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; pull quotes don&#39;t naturally lend themselves to the web as the effect is complex, lost on smaller devices and is a repeat of content that does not make sense (by default) to those using screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly though, Rachel Andrew&#39;s CSS Day 2025 presentation called &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NfwDP9shxNQ?t=2445&quot;&gt;Multicol and fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; talks about the idea of the web being more like printed pages going forward. She introduces the idea of &amp;quot;exclusions&amp;quot; (to normal flow). The examples she shows look much like the patterns designers often try to recreate with pull quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;popout center-me&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://noscript.show/img/exclusions.webp&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot from Rachel Andrew&#39;s talk showing print examples of large text excluded from normal document flow.&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;em&gt; A screenshot from Rachel Andrew&#39;s talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No Script Show uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://layout-breakouts-builder.vercel.app/&quot;&gt;named grid lines technique&lt;/a&gt; to allow some content to break out of the narrow (more readable) confines allowed for written text (as seen with the above image). This can be used to create something close to a typical pull quote pattern as shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://band.here24.co/music/street-lights-album&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://band.here24.co/music/shadow-album&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;regular-quotes&quot;&gt;Regular Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time we will be building up some copy and paste styles, but a good starting point is &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/getting-creative-with-quotes/&quot;&gt;this recent post on CSS tricks by Andy Clarke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show. This video is a follow up to our podcast episode called Don&#39;t Quote Us On This, where we looked at some of the confusion there is when it comes to writing semantic HTML for testimonials, pull quotes, and regular article quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find that at no script show slash 24, so the numerals two, four, and it&#39;s worth checking that out before watching this. Here though we&#39;re quickly looking at various approaches to styling these things. With CSS and as always, David Waumsley joins me over there with a lovely shirt today. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I put the screen on and crack on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, let&#39;s do that. &#39;cause this one will be quick. Okay. Because I haven&#39;t had the time to actually, do many variations of the sales on the things that we were talking about. Sure. But, I&#39;ve got some things to point out. I think when it comes to testimonials, which we talked about first time, there is, it seems pretty common to me to see those put in carousels of some form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously with us being a no script show, there&#39;s reasons why we want to avoid things that require JavaScript. If we can. So we&#39;re looking for simpler, resilient options. So there are a couple here that. Thought I&#39;d mention. and the first one is the, what is called the Real by Hayden Pickin because he&#39;s getting a mention again and Andy Bell in their every layout, and I use this on our site anyway, but I think it&#39;s a really good solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we go to their. cycle. See, it&#39;s been employed over here, so you just put the testimonials in this nice. And, looks nice so you can find it here. Unfortunately, the reel is under their premium thing, but if you want to see how it works, you can just go to the no script show and look at how we&#39;re using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. So if you could see the reel is effectively here, you can get the gist of how that is put together. It&#39;s horizontal scrolling. So that&#39;s one approach, instead of having a carousel when you&#39;ve got a lot. Yeah. And you don&#39;t wanna take up too much, of the vertical space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another one, which, I should have brought it up actually. and we&#39;ll just show it here in effect. So I&#39;ve done a little demo, which we&#39;ll use at some point. Let me just go to it, show you some reviews. So I&#39;ve. Lay these out. But another way which I needed to use was to just use the thing which we talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sort of details. Details and summary. Correct? Yes. And I&#39;ve got that as an example. And in fact, I&#39;m combining two things, which are on our intrinsic framework. I&#39;m combining this thing of setting a maximum column. So I&#39;ve got the sort of CSS here where we can just set these up, how many we want, and then it creates this sort of, if I can resize this sort of situation, but it doesn&#39;t go beyond three or whatever we set it to, put that inside the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just go back to. Our homepage where I can see it. And, we&#39;ve moved on since then. Let me have a look for the disclosure widget. So yeah, so I&#39;m just using the same disclosure widget there, but I&#39;m sticking that ram technique, those, grids within that. I think that works quite well. I did it on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I can just bring it up. If I can just search for this, earth. Affinity Center. Yeah, you&#39;ve got the URL there. Yeah. if I just go into there a couple, it was a problem that I had. I don&#39;t think the markup is good as I have here, but we had all these different sort of, reviews, which he collected and he collected so many and they were in this carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I never realized until I had to remake the site how many were, and you could see wow. Yeah. So I thought, that was the best way to deal with that. yeah. So that, so you pushed them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; into a container there, which has a maximum of whatever it was, six or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So on this case and then they just, and it&#39;s quite nice because responsibly then it will just adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. and I think, these are better, I dunno what you feel about them. I now hate it when I see a carousel for reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the beauty of the. the details block is that everything is definitively hidden until you touch the details. you invoke the detail, you open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. In fact, you open the accordion and then it&#39;s all. Available, whereas the carousel is somewhat available and you have to interact on an ongoing basis. So you have to continue to scroll and then scroll a bit more and then scroll a bit more and then scroll a bit more. If that works with your finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of almost feels like on a mobile device that kind of sweepy. Sweepy, yeah, something. Something quite good about that. &#39;cause we&#39;re used to that with all the applications, but I think on a desktop your I Imple implementation with the details is better. Because it&#39;s all on. All off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You toggle them all on, you toggle them all off. If you were to have, let&#39;s say that you had 50 on that page You just showed us that scroll bar is gonna be tiny. Maybe it&#39;s not 50, but It&#39;s a pro. Yes. it&#39;s probably not far off, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That on this though, I didn&#39;t do. So if we look at this one, if I go back to the, that one that I was doing, I limited the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you carried on with the scroll there. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so there&#39;s options. There&#39;s options. I actually. Quite like what you did, where you opened it all and then you had that big close button at the end. That seemed to work for me. Yes. Yeah. I think, I&#39;m not a fan of the carousel either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I, I think it&#39;s had its day, it was interesting, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; not, yeah, and I think this is why they argue on every layout and that you&#39;ll notice on websites that either of these guys have done, that they tend to employ the real quite a lot for their stuff because on a mobile. It does, you can do it with your finger, so it does, Scroll along quite nicely. so anyway, that&#39;s just a solution to avoid having to get into JavaScript until, the hope is because we had that initial excitement about, Google managing to put forward some new, HTML that would, give us carousels. Except it didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is they called it accessible. And then, There was Susan Suan who Yeah. Did real experiments on it and said, no, actually it&#39;s not. So it&#39;s still ongoing. It&#39;s ongoing. It&#39;s not a work, we it&#39;s a work in progress. It&#39;s not finished. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So that might get changed over the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll just, Let&#39;s just go over, I did do on a intrinsic framework, I did mock up. If anyone wants the sort of way I&#39;ve coded this up with these example testimonial here, I&#39;ll probably keep adding to these. so I&#39;ve put in the HTML, which we were talking about in the way that we would do it now, given What we learned in the. The first part of this, and then here there&#39;s not much to say on it. so basically if we look at this, so how it works is that we start mobile first. So we just set those up. Yep. And then have them go into the grid past a certain point Into the three, which not that difficult for anyone to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there were a couple of things here that I put in the code, which I thought were quite interesting. and new one was, and, people who are watching this show won&#39;t get it. But you had, an accessibility expert look at our site, didn&#39;t you? Yeah. Joe Dolson. Yeah. Yeah. Joel Dolson and I, although I saw it, he reminded me how we could use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m using it here to put in this sort of. CSS generated content here and then escape it from screen readers by just putting in a blank, which we, which is new CSS Alt that we can have with this. Yeah, that was novel, wasn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So you had to have a blank for it to work. So like in effect, you think it not being there would be superior, but having a container with nothing in it was in fact what you needed to do, which is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so I&#39;m able to just put this with the little stars just so it&#39;s decorative. Yeah, it looks nice. Doesn&#39;t mean anything at all. Yeah. But you can do it. And as we can now do it with generated content without, having that read out to screen readers, which is quite nice. The other thing that was just employed on there, which is worth, as I say, we use a media query then to bring in the grids and I&#39;ve just put three columns on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be anything. Yeah. And any other thing that I&#39;ve put in there. When it does get to that, I wanted to use sub grid. To make sure that whatever size of the quote is here, that the people and their details line up. They all stay the same. Yeah. They all line up at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s in a subgrid related to that, but That&#39;s it really. There&#39;s lots of different ways. Nice. Yeah. It&#39;s just a simple thing, but it&#39;s a good starting point when we do our projects or something to say, oh, that&#39;s how I coded it up before,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just to say, obviously I&#39;m putting the URL on the screen if you want to get. This, if you wanna be able to see where this code is, you can obviously look in the URL bar on our screen, but head to no script show slash learn slash one five number 15, and the links as you can see on the screen are right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just click on them and you&#39;ll be able to get to all of these bits and pieces. Sorry to interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, it&#39;s good. so I think that just covers testimonials. So let&#39;s go back to pull quotes again, something which I&#39;ve, I think maybe ever used once in my career. Do you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; know what, when you see them in a printed magazine, which we can now see on the screen, so we&#39;re looking at, I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s, some magazine, vanity Fair or National Geographic or whatever it may be there, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it effective? It&#39;s like super effective, especially as the, you&#39;ve got this columned layout of text, like it just jumps at you does, it really stands out. Yeah. Typically in on the web, we&#39;re never gonna employ three columns of text like that. So I think the opportunity to make it stand out quite as effectively as that is less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there, it&#39;s profound. it&#39;s like it&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re gonna look at. You can&#39;t escape it. It&#39;s brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, design wise, and you can understand why people love these pull quotes. &#39;cause a lot of the designers who&#39;ve gone to the web started in print, didn&#39;t they? And they want this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in contradiction to what we was talking about in the first part with Jeremy, Keith&#39;s argument, why do we have these on the web? They don&#39;t suit the web at all. because the duplicate content, annoying people, &#39;cause screen readers can&#39;t understand it. And then we have it. Technical difficulties of making these work on all screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s good reasons not to have poll quotes, but interestingly, just recently, it was released actually on YouTube, so you can actually watch the Talk by Rachel Andrews, for the CSS day. Thousand 25 and later in there, I&#39;ve actually linked to the timestamp where she shows this and she talks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s talking about multi columns, which I use quite a lot, this way of being able to just automatically generate columns and she&#39;s working on the spec of that Uhhuh. One of the big problems she has is multicolor and fragmentation. Fragmentation is about how you control what automatically gets shipped over to the next row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Anyway, so that&#39;s mainly what it talks about. But she also talks about the idea of exclusions. So it&#39;s not there in HTML, but she&#39;s asking the basic question, how much do we need it? Because with exclusions, the idea that you could exclude something from the normal flow, Rather than a sort of fragmentation that&#39;s excluded from the normal flow, everything can go around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course when you think about it, that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;d want for things like pull quotes like this, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So does it sit somewhere else then? can you, in this idea, would you specify it would belong at the end? or would it just disappear entirely, if So it&#39;d be presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;d be there, but you wouldn&#39;t be able to see it. For example, on a screen reader, it would just evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I dunno the answer to this. I think if there&#39;s a demand for it, they&#39;ll start to look into how they can implement this. So the implementations are known at the moment, but while she&#39;s looking at it, how much do we want these kind of design patterns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she does make a point, updating &#39;cause generally, and she would be part of that group. We&#39;ve generally said, look, the web isn&#39;t like print, no, forget that. But as she started to look at fragmentation, she started to look at how you might fragment these things. Particularly some people still want to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact you can print our articles actually, &#39;cause I put the code in for that. She&#39;s thinking that you now can fragment stuff. So things go into pages. So if we want the web can behave a little bit more Print, Yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; honestly looking, okay, this is a curious aside. For the first time in probably 15 years, I subscribed to a magazine last week and it arrived, and I just loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the way it was presented and the way it was laid out was just so alien to me. And I did that curious thing where I tried to, I forgot, and I literally tried to pinch and zoom and on a bit of text and then I laughed at myself as I did it, but it was so pleasurable to see. Quirky layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. That obviously at the moment we&#39;ve pushed against that. It&#39;s we just want this one column. why do we want this one column? increasingly, we obviously on a mobile that would be desirable, but on a big screen, which many of us have got the privilege of having something quirky would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columned layouts. Why not? Yeah. it&#39;s fascinating and it&#39;s artistic. Yes, as much as anything else, it lends some sort of, okay, this, they&#39;re credible, they&#39;re artistic, this is what they do, vanity Fair or something, or Vogue or whatever. something like that would really be able to lean into that, wouldn&#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that&#39;s their whole thing is creativity and artistry and all of that. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I would trust Rachel Andrews if she was behind the spec on it. Obviously that&#39;s one of her jobs, as she says. &#39;cause no one else wanted it. &#39;cause the multi Coles have been around for quite some time. yeah. Up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nobody uses them, right? I do. quite a lot now. Okay. You use them. Okay. But you, it, that&#39;s where, the spec isn&#39;t as it should be. &#39;cause there&#39;s been lots of ideas and that&#39;s around fragmentation about the fact that, when you put something into multi coal, then you have to control what is falling as you change your screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And sometimes that can be awkward. So you can, that&#39;s the fragmentation side, but it does lead onto the question. And the same also, it links into what she&#39;s done with grid and the future spec of grid, where now we can. with CSS, we, it, we can control right? how things are read out to screen readers, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our design patterns are going all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so the browser could intelligently apportion the. 3000 words of text into manageable, three column layouts in a grid or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yes, but it&#39;s more about just when our layouts, the problem is, if we put something left and right or something and it falls underneath, but it falls the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It&#39;s gotta be able to, it&#39;s gotta read the dom order, but the dom order&#39;s going to need to change with the CSS that&#39;s moving that around visually. Yeah. that&#39;s coming into grid. So I imagine within this, I mean I guess you&#39;re thinking ahead, at the moment it&#39;s just at the stage of do we want this, is there a big demand for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because obviously there&#39;s a lot of work to do, there&#39;s a lot of convincing the browsers to get on board with the how to solve this. It&#39;s an interesting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; kind of reversal of the last 10 years of. The internet it feels like, but it&#39;s nice. I think it&#39;s a brilliant, it&#39;s quite refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Yes. So I think, yes, really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s, anyway, there&#39;s just that. But in terms of, in terms of pull quotes, &#39;cause they are quite difficult to do. I&#39;ve done a little cheat, which I think works because we use on the no script show. In fact, I can even do this probably if I just put the inspect on here. I just show it quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are, as you can see here, probably just about, we can see the lines so I can have content as I&#39;m, in fact showing here it&#39;s breaking it out of the main body without having to open up a new div. So I thought the next thing, and I did it here, let me just bring this up. just on that demo thing, you could use the same, yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so it&#39;s a pretty easy thing. We would use that as standard to do that there. And then I did another one, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s nice. I really like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So it looks okay as it moves to whatever size you&#39;ve got. &#39;cause it starts to move a little bit in until it&#39;s just that regular old heading it looks like almost, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. And these name line things are easy. And I just did another one. Which one did I open? Let&#39;s have a look at this one. This is a bit more awkward. Good. Because then I, and I&#39;ve had to put the text. So this is what is a sort of pop out size. And then I&#39;ve had to book Yeah, the text. Yeah, that&#39;s a curious,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s a curious demonstration of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause you really want the text to wrap and I suppose it now it suddenly works, but on deck and do you know what it&#39;s not. Jankey, but I can see why it might annoy your aesthetics. it might, because a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; lot of the pull quotes here are often lined up this side and then, yeah. Because I would&#39;ve to do a lot of work to do that and I&#39;m, and then if it was non left aligned for a right, for a left to right reader, that would be, yeah, that would be a faux part,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; wouldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; For anybody who doesn&#39;t know about, I think we&#39;ve mentioned it before, if you want to make these nine, na named grid lines for your pages, then there&#39;s a great generator over here, that allows you to do that. So the link is in our show notes, so you can just set up your own grid lines. Yeah, once, once you&#39;ve got the code for this, it&#39;s complex code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve got the code for this, you can just. Change the numbers you want for the w, is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gonna be in the show notes as well? Will that be, yeah, the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; link to this generator, and we&#39;re using it all the time, it&#39;s on our site as well. So you can, again, just look at the code there, but I thought it does allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. We are going to do this quickly. I think that&#39;s all I needed to cover there. And then for regular quotes, luckily just as. In this thinking that, oh, I need to do some styling to show Then the lovely Andy Clark came to the rescue Yeah, exactly. With the CSS tricks article. So we&#39;ll have a look at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it seems like a good starting point. He, in this article, which I won&#39;t go into, just gives a whole load of code for styling these different block quotes. Nice. And it&#39;s Andy Clark, so they&#39;re always beautiful as always. I. And that&#39;s really what they&#39;re brilliant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well. Some of them aren&#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They, I&#39;m particularly drawn to these much more straightforward ones where it&#39;s just some sort of separator at the top and the bottom. Yes. I like that. Not quite so into the, I don&#39;t know, the icons at top and bottom and the surrounding it with a speech bubble or something. It&#39;s less for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they&#39;re beautiful. You&#39;re right, they&#39;re very, they&#39;re quite nice actually, now that I&#39;ve said that, quite like those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; The one thing though I will notice here is this little, so we see this sort of really beautiful pull screen on his example here. Yeah. What he doesn&#39;t provide us with, maybe there&#39;ll be an article following this up because been using this demo site for different articles, but I&#39;d love to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he&#39;s actually turned that into a code and how he&#39;s done that. Yeah. and I suppose it&#39;s similar to what I&#39;ve been showing there, but I would like to see how he goes about it. Yeah, that&#39;s interesting. But it&#39;s not there in the article. But otherwise there&#39;s, it&#39;s a good starting point I think to pick up some CSS to start with this and, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So this is, on CSS tricks.com. Again, the link will be in the, the show notes. Yeah. there&#39;s the url, no script show slash learn slash 1 5 15. Yes. There we go. And I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; think I&#39;ve lost my notes, but I Yeah, There&#39;s the end at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; We&#39;re at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:56] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; We are at the end. Actually, if I just go back here, let&#39;s just check my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we&#39;re done. We&#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. In that case, I will, I will take your screen away and, and we&#39;ll just mention one more time where you can go and find it. the piece of content which came before this. So if you&#39;re curious about what we spoke about and the trials and tribulations from a kind of a technical point of view, but it&#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech. woo. That didn&#39;t work. There we go. No script show slash 2 4 24. That&#39;s the, the preamble to this episode if you like. And obviously if you want the show notes there, you can find them. But if you want the bits and pieces for this one, no script show slash learn. Slash 1 5 15. So there we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it. We will see you next time. David, thanks so much for your, for your hard work. I&#39;m riding on your coattails. Thanks a lot. Alright, see you next. Easy. Bye. Yeah, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

    <title>Are we right in the head?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/23/" />
    <updated>2025-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/23/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-head-element&quot;&gt;What is the head element?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A HTML element for machine-readable metadata on web documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can only be one head element with only these 8 tags:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt; &amp;lt;base&amp;gt; &amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically it follows the &lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt; and is the first thing in the HTML element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&amp;useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&amp;acceptlanguage=&amp;doc=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2F&quot;&gt;validating&lt;/a&gt; the HTML
 particularly with CMS&#39;s where others have access to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;essentials-of-the-head-element&quot;&gt;Essentials of the head element&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A meta tag to set the document charset to &lt;abbr title=&quot;Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit&quot;&gt;UTF-8.&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A metatag to set the viewport to an initial scale to 1 (responsive).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A title tag to name the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-issues&quot;&gt;Common Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled.html&quot;&gt;WCAG 2.2&lt;/a&gt; we must have title tags that describe the topic or purpose of a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid special characters and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/&quot;&gt;certain types&lt;/a&gt; of punctuation.*&lt;small&gt; Dashes are safe, but screen readers can read &amp;quot;|&amp;quot;  as &amp;quot;pipe&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; or as a pause.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep titles short and consistent across pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; near the top of the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; for quick loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just outsite the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; it&#39;s worth mentioning that not setting &lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html lang=””&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html&quot;&gt;WCAG fail&lt;/a&gt; (and missing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/million/&quot;&gt;15% of websites&lt;/a&gt;!).**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/023052.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; also says to avoid the vertical line symbol too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/blog/case-study-should-you-add-pipes-or-dashes-to-your-title-ag-/&quot;&gt;Semrush&lt;/a&gt;  did an experiment and overall dashes seemed to bring in more organic traffic than vertical lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**  Overwriting lang=&quot;&quot; and styling it for international phrases and words is underused. It’s pointless these days to cram loads of keywords into titles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux-page-load&quot;&gt;UX - page load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As HTML is rendered line by line, &lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/&quot;&gt;Harry Roberts&lt;/a&gt; has demonstrated how important to performance structure is. He suggests we should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move what we can out of the head (trackers, JS and some CSS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid @import and redirects to 3rd parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put synchronous JS before CSS. Browsers see if JS refers to CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put &lt;abbr title=&quot;Content Security Policy&quot;&gt;CSP&lt;/abbr&gt; headers top as they break parallel preloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naturally, there&#39;s more to discuss such as the benefits of preloading/prefetching assets, speculative loading and when we should use inline CSS, but this offers a great overview.  Harry also has a neat &lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/ct/&quot;&gt;bookmark&lt;/a&gt; we can check our heads with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux-design&quot;&gt;UX - design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing links to Favicons and metadata for Open Graph and Twitter images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favicons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-26-release-notes&quot;&gt;Safari 26&lt;/a&gt; we have support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg&quot;&gt;SVG favicons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG icons can respond to light and dark preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still need an .ico fall back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://metatags.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnoscript.show%2Fabout&quot;&gt;metatags.io&lt;/a&gt; is good for checking OG and Twitter images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a social image has enough white space one image can serve all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need an image to stop social media showing the first in the DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The No Script Show&#39;s uses YouTube&#39;s thumbnail on the episode pages. For all others there is a generic image. Titles and descriptions for social media is added, but is not needed as it is the same the site&#39;s meta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-seo&quot;&gt;Technical SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things we might want to include in our head tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/robots.txt&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;for search engine crawl and indexing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;canonical&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to prevent duplicate content issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;robots&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;noindex&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for duplicate content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; hreflang=&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for international sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;inline-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/feed.xml&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;application/atom+xml&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  for RSS feeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With CMSs and large content sites the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; can easily become the source of technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.link-assistant.com/website-auditor/&quot;&gt;Web Auditor&lt;/a&gt; was run on the No Script Show it showed scores of 301 redirects as a few dynamic URLs were set up without a trailing forward slash (/).  Not major, but extra work for the user&#39;s browser that could be easily fixed. See the report &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/img/SEO-audit.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (The errors are false positives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;Screaming Frog&#39;s SEO Spider&lt;/a&gt;  is a partly free (up to 500 URLs) alternative checker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No Script Show has not added Schema.org mark-up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization&quot;&gt;Organization schema&lt;/a&gt; might be good for some companies. Perhaps a good signal for Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content&quot;&gt;E-E-A-T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our third in a series looking at various components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re talking about the head element as it&#39;s unseen by visitors. The head is easily overlooked, but a few mistakes can have a dramatic effect on the site overall. As with all episodes in this series, this is in two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we&#39;ll talk about. Head elements from a technical design and accessibility, SEO as well perspective. Then we&#39;ll follow up with a YouTube video looking at some coded examples. And as always, there&#39;s David Waumsley who does all the hard work. Hello David. Hello. we call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this one, are we right in the head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we&#39;ve established, I definitely wasn&#39;t right in the head, but I&#39;ve been getting professional help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you, yeah, from a variety of different websites. I might add, not from the medics. I, read the show notes, which you always, you know, very faithfully put together for us. And I have to confess, it&#39;s been a long time since I looked at something, which I&#39;m gonna call so basic and it really alarmed me that this incredibly crucial and basic thing I basically didn&#39;t know anything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, not great. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So we got some show notes. Sure. We bring them up then. Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; There we are. So are we right in the head? Let&#39;s, let&#39;s kick it off. So the first one, what is the head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so what I&#39;ve got here, it&#39;s fairly simple. It&#39;s A-H-T-M-L element for machine readable metadata on web documents, and this is something which I don&#39;t think I ever knew as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that there could only be one head on a page and I didn&#39;t know that there were only eight tags that are supported. No, me neither. And they are, we know these Title link, style, meta and script and no script knew those. Yep. Base and template. I didn&#39;t really, I think I understand base. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that was the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; alarming thing. The first ones that you mentioned. So title, link style, meta script, no script. That was all fine and self-explanatory. However, I saw base and template and Yeah. Basically didn&#39;t know what either of them were for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, to be honest, I dunno why I stuck on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause, I don&#39;t know. And I think base is the one where you can set the URLs that I used so you could change the whole, it has a knock on effect. So if you are only including these certain URLs, it&#39;s a little bit like you can leave the full domain name off your document forward slash so you could have your base being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no script show and then you could change that to something else, I think. Got it. That&#39;s what it does there. Okay. template I&#39;m not so sure on. Okay. We&#39;ll just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; swiftly move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, let&#39;s do that. And it typically follows the doc type HTML, tag that we have, which is a lot simpler these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we would talk reminiscent about the times in the early HTML, where there all these different versions you&#39;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; have. That&#39;s right. It was like a full two lines of impenetrable stuff that you had to basically copy and paste. I could never remember what was required, so I would just copy and paste it every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was, set and it was XT X-H-T-M-L and all of these numbers and things followed on. But then I think HT ML five came along and, I don&#39;t know, I think you said about 2010, something like that and boiled it all down to this simple declaration doc type HTML, which made everything, all of that nonsense go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, because you literally had to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; pick, didn&#39;t you? Which team were going to be on, Yeah. and, generally the head is the, first thing that goes in the HTML element itself. And I&#39;ve just put here because somebody else told me this, will mention that person, Harry Robertson. It&#39;s a good idea to go and validate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&#39;t do this these days, but there is the validator@wthree.org, which is good for HT ML validation. and we passed. I&#39;ve just done it on our site. Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Great. Yeah. So we passed. You followed all of those things. You didn&#39;t include a tag that couldn&#39;t be included or shouldn&#39;t be included, and you&#39;ve got your, document declaration correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bravo, yeah. First thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yay. I do that now and I haven&#39;t done that. We used to do that in the early years. Again, used to have those little tags that you could put saying that this was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; valid. H-T-M-L-I know, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, nobody does. Nobody does that these days, but perhaps we should. But there is a caveat with that because a lot of what is seen as good practice is often used in a lot of inline modern CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you do that, is gonna churn out lots of errors. &#39;cause it doesn&#39;t recognize modern CSS in there. if it doesn&#39;t validate, it&#39;s not necessarily a problem. okay, so let&#39;s talk about the essentials that we need in a head element. These three things that we really must have in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s a meta tag to set the documents character set to what is UTF eight, which, oh, David, come on. What does that mean? He says, because you can&#39;t see it on the screen there, but I&#39;m hovering over it &#39;cause I&#39;ve put it in there. It means Unicode transformation format eight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; bit. Okay. I didn&#39;t know any of that, and I still don&#39;t even get what that does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I get it. You&#39;ve got to include it. why eight bit? I&#39;m not asking that as a question because I&#39;m, I don&#39;t know if one, but, anyway, it&#39;s required, but what if we made it into a nine or a seven? What would happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know how it works, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we know what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know we need it. Yeah. Yeah. It allows all those. All those unicodes that are in your fonts or available, any way to be able to use them. And I use them a lot actually. I use like little arrows and stuff and yes, triangles all over. And if I didn&#39;t have that, I don&#39;t think it would recognize them. So yeah, so we&#39;ve got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need a meta tag at two set of view ports to initial scale of one for responsiveness. If we don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be on our mobile phones and it&#39;ll try and show us a desktop view, too wide. We need that and we need a title tag, a name for the document. So particularly screen readers for accessibility so they can read that first and know where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; which, so sorry, just quickly. Then those three are the basics. Like we, we have the, list of eight that you can use, but those three are the ones that you must have, you cannot pass go unless you&#39;ve got those three included. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I suspect you prob you&#39;ve just get. Problems with it, won&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll get problems with your characters, you&#39;ll get problems with scaling. Yeah. And you&#39;ll just annoy a lot of people who won&#39;t know where they are. Accessibility and a title. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. Yeah, so really the rest of this is about the common issues. Many of these. If not most, I didn&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is through other people&#39;s work. So for accessibility to meet, basic, the basic standard I&#39;ve put down here will tag 2.2. We must have title tags that describe the topical purpose of a page. And I&#39;ve got, for those who can see it on YouTube, I&#39;ve got the document up here. So we just need to make it clear and consistent what our pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are telling us on this. So typically I think, and I used to be terrible at this, I used to keep my, I used to put keyword cram stuff &#39;cause I was into the SEO all the stuff and I didn&#39;t have a consistency. It wasn&#39;t, now it is about, and it&#39;s no script show on our thing and contact, no script show and keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the one that was really fascinating, the first bullet point I got here was to avoid special characters and certain types of punctuation. And it&#39;s, again, Sarah Suan an accessibility course, which she, it was a sort of passing reference to it, but it&#39;s really dangerous for screen readers to be able to put certain things in, so dashes are safe, but when it comes to the vertical line or the pipe, or the line symbol, or whatever you call it, a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May choose, depending on which one or combination with your browsers. Choose to read out pipeline or just pause as it would do with the dash. Oh, pause would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; a total catastrophe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; wouldn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it? no, pause is fine. Just to pause between the, pause. Oh, I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s not gonna end there. It&#39;s literally no, just create a, like a one second pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Got it. Got it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So it&#39;ll work as a dash. So the safest thing is Dash. And honestly, you&#39;ve been good. You were just telling me that you&#39;ve generally gone dashes. Suddenly I have this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I only went with dashes just &#39;cause I went with dashes. I could easily have done pipes, but I just went with dashes forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve used. But pipes to me look more. Appropriate un unless it happens to coincide with a lowercase L, in which case it looks sometimes like you&#39;ve got two or three Ls next to each, other. So that&#39;s weird. But I didn&#39;t really, I didn&#39;t realize that obviously, back in the day when I started doing titles, I didn&#39;t realize that the pipe was gonna be read out by a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there you go. Avoid at all costs. Good, bit of advice. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. I jumped onto it only recently thinking they look quite cool people do this, use pipes. I&#39;m gonna use pipes. And now I realize that it could cause some accessibility problems. But just not only that, interestingly enough, Google also, and I&#39;ve linked to a document where they say this, they say avoid vertical lines, but I don&#39;t think they explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a SEMrush, experiment that they did. A case study where they changed their, pipes for dashes and, it&#39;s not entirely conclusive, but there was a improvement on the visitors they had to the site for doing that, which isn&#39;t that interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you, not only is it not recommended for the accessibility side of things, but it also appears that Google etal are also giving it some negative weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I dunno why it would change things. it must be a visual thing. Perhaps people can read dashes, it makes more sense. I don&#39;t know. But anyway, according to their bit of research, so there&#39;s another benefit to doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yes. Still, I&#39;ve gone off my points here. You&#39;re on keep title short and consistent across pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you covered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that a little bit already. Yeah, I, did, I jumped ahead and so I&#39;ll go on to the next one, which is keep the title near to the top of the head for quick loading because obviously if you are on a screen reader or even even if. we&#39;ll move on to that and how the order&#39;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that comes in last, it can be very confusing If something&#39;s blocking your title coming up, you don&#39;t quite know where you are. And it&#39;s even worse for a screen reader, users who need to know where they&#39;ve landed. So yeah, that&#39;s, a key thing. And it&#39;s not in the head, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that not setting the HML language attribute to something is a wagg fail as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even. The present stats on this, it&#39;s roughly, it, was amongst the top million sites. There is 15% of sites that don&#39;t have one still, which is quite incredible, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that is interesting. I, again, not something because I&#39;m a CMS user and kind of assumed that my CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing all of this correctly, all of this is fascinating, and when we finish this episode, I&#39;m going to go and, berate myself for what my CMS of Choice is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it&#39;s doing, I think on the sites that I see with you. It is. Got it. And it&#39;s got the, interesting thing about that one is, so it, great Britain is the one that&#39;s been chosen for yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So gb is. it says English as the language, and that&#39;s all screen readers can deal with. They&#39;re not going to pick out particular accent for England, but you have got England with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I go deeper? Can I select Yorkshire Britain as well? It&#39;ll make, yeah, but it&#39;ll make no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; impact on those people, but it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Moving on. UX page load. Yeah, I see you&#39;ve got a dash there. Well done. No pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the interesting bit for me and this is why I thought it was its own topic. So there was a great talk by Harry Roberts, who&#39;s a, performance expert. He works on all with all sorts of big, companies. So he is done a lot of research and there&#39;s a really good, I&#39;ve linked to it, the video there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where his talk is about getting your head straight and he demonstrates how important structure is, what the order you put things in your head really impacts on your page load. And I&#39;m just gonna cover this quickly &#39;cause we&#39;ll look at it in the next video where I&#39;ve got the sort of code really that&#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I think the key points for is, that. firstly is that it&#39;s the biggest because HTML renders everything from the top of the page, line by line. It makes the head the biggest render blocking element on your page. So from the start, it&#39;s. Anything that doesn&#39;t need to be in the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says shift out. So if you&#39;ve got all these sort of trackers or even some CSS that can go in the body these days and any Java script that doesn&#39;t need to be there, get rid of it, get it out the head because that will speed things up. His other main point is, avoid things like imports and redirects to other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you think where has to call out? Grab some information in there. I don&#39;t, there was a big debate, and I dunno if you ever fell on one side of this, about using Google fonts, whether you should, locally load them or whether you should be using their own CDN for this. And there was a lot of people argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the CDM was faster than anything you would like. Yeah. In&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; terms of speed, I was always swung. mo more recently I was swung just by the GDPR argument, not by the speed argument. So that kind of settled it for me. I didn&#39;t look at that. Again, it&#39;s like Google fonts. I, want to load those locally now just because the Germans are gonna come and get me if, if I don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that&#39;s, that was decision made and, I honestly, I&#39;d forgotten that there was any kind of. Possibility that it would be loaded quicker. My expectation though, would be that if you loaded it from a CDN, given Google&#39;s might, and the fact that it&#39;s got edges everywhere, I would&#39;ve thought that would have been quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is another request. It&#39;s got a, it&#39;s got to be requested, then it&#39;s got to satisfy that request. but yeah, I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. according to Harry, no. really it all slows it down. and honestly I did a big for a long period actually, but. Using a page builder. And a lot of the people there thought it was faster with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, WP Rocket, which I used as a plugin, used to argue that it&#39;s better to use the CDN. Okay. And they used to pre-render that or, ahead of time. But no, in what all my experiments, it was the opposite. Local loading was always faster. So I think Harry&#39;s right on that one, but it&#39;s just Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting. And the other thing, this is the, I thought was the most interesting thing in this talk was that we should put synchronous JavaScript before synchronous CSS or really any CSS. And I didn&#39;t know this. And the perfect example is, and I would&#39;ve done this, I&#39;m sure, yeah, it&#39;s not true any longer, but used to get, the Google Analytics code used to be synchronously loading in the early days, the legacy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it would always tell you to put that at the top of your head. Yeah. And you would go, nah, I&#39;m not putting you, doesn&#39;t matter. Top. Yeah, that&#39;s right. I want the CSS first. You put it last, but what Heaves recognized out this, and I thought this is the most revealing thing, is that. It will block it because the JavaScript needs to know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sees JavaScript, but it needs to know whether it refers to any CSS that you might have, which it might well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So if you put the CSS first, it goes, hold on. We have to read the whole, just wait there. We have to read the JavaScript and then we&#39;ll come back to your cs. Yeah, so it, it blocks the whole thing, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synchronous JavaScript and you before your CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that makes perfect sense when you say it out loud, but again, yeah. Not something that I had given much thought to. &#39;cause those, things are usually mysteriously hidden away and you don&#39;t bother looking at what the content of that JavaScript package might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it does make sense. If it&#39;s gonna call some CSS, why not allow it to have access to the CSS because it&#39;s, it the JavaScript comes first. Yeah. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And the other thing, I think that was most revealing, but something that doesn&#39;t really affect me. But if you have these, CSP headers or content security policy headers, that restrict, where you can bring in things from, you restrict the sources that you, that a lot of people put them quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they would, according to his research, it would break that parallel preloading that you automatically get, so everything will simultaneously load at the same time. If it can do, if you see, oh, okay. And if you put this somewhere down the bottom, it breaks all of that happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so you need to put that right at the very, top. He doesn&#39;t mention it, but interestingly, I double checked it and it&#39;s actually one of the policies, if you&#39;re using a content security policy for security reasons, you need to put it as one of the first things in your head, not just for performance as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, so four important points, most of which I would completely have. Forgotten about and disregarded, therefore, but that&#39;s, none of that is hard to remember. Is it? That all makes sense. I&#39;m never gonna be using the CSPs anyway. In all honesty, it&#39;s, and most of it, again, in all honesty, I&#39;m letting, WordPress, the CMSI use handle much of this, but it all makes sense doing it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, there is. a quick little tool. I&#39;ll just bring that up over here, which is a little bookmark you can use that&#39;s been made by Harry, where I&#39;ve actually got it in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I saw that. I, put it in as well and I had a quite, a very quick play. Did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; let&#39;s just go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; back to our site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; What does it, yeah, you can click it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now. You might have to reload it. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I think you should come in there. yeah, its pointed out this isn&#39;t very revealing. It&#39;s pointing out that a blocking style sheet that we&#39;ve got is the fact that I&#39;ve. I&#39;ve got a link to my style sheets here. It&#39;s actually a bundled together one rather than inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s a ongoing argument isn&#39;t about whether where you or when and where you should use inline CSS. And where you should interesting enough is quite interesting. Of course, I went to his site just so we can show Harry the person behind all of this. There is, and if we stick it on his, oh, look at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s got black Mark here. His title is blocked by JavaScript. Oh. But of course. No, it&#39;s actually, I had a quick look. I thought it&#39;s, what&#39;s he doing then? He is actually got a little bit of JavaScript, which is measuring the performance of his head. So he&#39;s obviously Oh, okay. He&#39;s obviously doing some testing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. He&#39;s, being very,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; thorough. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. anyway, so great little bookmark on that. I think maybe I need to refresh just, oh, we didn&#39;t need it. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s ct, what&#39;s that called again? That was, yes, further down. It&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you find it, you&#39;ll find it on CSS wizardry if you go to our site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the link is there. Yeah. dot com and CT will get that page up and then you can just add it to your bookmark there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfect. Oh, okay. And I&#39;ll read that into the audio. So the, this show is gonna be on no script show. Oh yeah. Slash 23, the numeral. So no script show slash two three. You&#39;ll be able to follow the, follow the links and get that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyway. I, thought that gives a great, as I&#39;ve made the point here, there&#39;s lots of other things to talk about with speed, preloading stuff, speculative loading is something that we&#39;ll look at a little bit later and that, do you have any thoughts on the inline CSS? I&#39;ve noticed that with the WordPress stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been a move to stick a lot of your CSS in the head now in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and in all honesty, I&#39;ve I&#39;ve just deferred that responsibility to the CMS itself. it&#39;s, this whole show is so interesting to me just because of the fact that I&#39;ve relegated almost every decision. To the CSS, and so I will have thoughts on it going forwards, but up until this point, the answer is basically no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t been doing any of that. I&#39;ve just been using a theme, the author of whom I respect, hoping that they&#39;re doing all of those bits and pieces correctly. And again, with things like plugins hoping that they&#39;re honoring the this that we&#39;re talking about. But I&#39;m sure that if I was to go in and inspect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably wouldn&#39;t be the way I want it. it&#39;s always been a style. did you say whether things should be in line or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I just think it&#39;s been, yeah, I&#39;ve always gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with a style sheet, to be honest. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; most of what you have hasn&#39;t because of the fact that the CMS is, and it&#39;s not just WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say it&#39;s typical for WordPress, but also, we&#39;ve used the 11 base blog for our site here. By default, I changed it. It, he was outputting it in line. and I&#39;ve changed it. To go to a link. Which Go to a style sheet. yeah, Which is a render blocking thing. But I, think the thing is, the advantage of, inline is the fact that you stop that render blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the disadvantage is that every new page you go to after that, you haven&#39;t got it cached any longer. So it has to. Reload that from your inline. Whereas that&#39;s true. Yeah. Yeah. So that&#39;s your, if you think people are going to go to more than one page, then probably, you better, it makes sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; to go with a resource rather than inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Anyway, it&#39;s just. We won&#39;t get into that any further. let&#39;s move on to next thing. So UX design side of things. So yeah, there&#39;s an element of design that comes into our heads, even though users don&#39;t see it. We have fons and we have our metadata for our social networks, open graph and Twitter images or X images as they maybe call it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s a bit of news on that. So I thought this was really fascinating. It&#39;s really recent. It&#39;s only Safari 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&#39;t know this either. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s just in June and I think it&#39;s fully out now. And actually if you look, so they&#39;re supporting SVG Favicons, and actually if I just go to the link here, we&#39;ll notice, can I use these, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So globally we&#39;re at almost 78% now with this. And honestly, since I start, I put started this article maybe a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. And it&#39;s probably gone up. by 2%. okay, so obviously this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; huh? Because of safari. &#39;cause of Safari 26. Yeah. So it&#39;s across the board now. Safari was the holdout. Now safari&#39;s come on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re basically good to go. Svg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and the good thing about the SVD Fon is that you can have light and dark modes with it. Something you can&#39;t do with the,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; when you say you can do light and dark modes, does it not automatically do you have to. Predefine a light in a dark one, or does it render it differently if it detects that it&#39;s on dark mode, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, you&#39;ll need to put it, you&#39;ll need to use the CSS, prefers. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s it. Color scheme and have an alternative to switch to. But it means it supports that. Quite interesting. I&#39;m just looking at the, can I use here? So it&#39;s actually a lot lower, 60, nearly 62% in USA and 64. percent in uk, but of course here in India we are way ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice. 94%. I wonder why, what is it that we&#39;re doing differently? I think it&#39;s probably there are less users of, and I think this is where the hold off would be of, mobiles. With Safari on it. Less, apple products, I would guess. Okay. and nearly everybody&#39;s on the mobile, so Yeah. Got it. So supported there where I&#39;m Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Yeah. So, we still need our ICO fallback. With that on our side, I&#39;ve really just put a very simple one. you can really spend a lot of time, you can either embed, can&#39;t you, different sizes in that format. Yep, So it works in different, and I haven&#39;t done that. You&#39;ve just gone for the one teeny tiny one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one tiny, yeah, because I think this is the way forward, but I think it&#39;s really fascinating. We&#39;ll look at the code anyway a little bit for the SVG icons, but I think it&#39;s really cool that you can now create your icon and within that SVG you can add in your preferreds color scheme and the. Device is going to swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it&#39;s actually on our site here, but we&#39;ll show that I think in the video. the other thing, social media wise, yeah, a great little tool, that I like to use is meta tags.io, which allows you to check what you&#39;ve got on your site. So I&#39;ve done it on here and it shows you all the sort of how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your image might show on the different platforms. I like that. That&#39;s right. Yeah. you can generally get away. So this is the generic one on the about page that I&#39;ve used. But actually what we&#39;re doing on our site is we&#39;re bothering the YouTube thumbnail. So when we put the YouTube video up, it&#39;s outputting on those episode pages that, but yeah, I think that&#39;s pretty cool that you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use if you put enough pad in around it. So you need a sort of rough Yeah. You just get away with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; one, can&#39;t you? If you just make sure that it&#39;s not too Exactly. I, it&#39;s just not bleeding to the edges unless it&#39;s just ordinary gradients or colors. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly, because Twitter&#39;s slightly different to Facebook, or Facebook is a little bit odd because it&#39;s usually a 16 to nine ratio, yeah. And that&#39;s what Twitter uses, but the other doesn&#39;t, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do we still care about things like that though? What I mean is like, how is it that those platforms still have the sway that they have over this kind of stuff? I guess it&#39;s just because they are the way people are consuming things, but, although there&#39;s like a hotbed of people who use X globally, it&#39;s a tiny platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form really compared to the likes of Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. But nevertheless, I guess they just, yeah, they set the agenda and they get to keep the, they get to keep the spoils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And if you&#39;ve got the format, the two formats for, the open graph, it&#39;s gonna be used by all the other ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blue Sky and Slack and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; all those kind of things. On, my SEO plugin of choice in WordPress, it, just requires those two, it calls it Facebook and Twitter. and you just, and it gives you a demo much like you&#39;ve just seen inside the plugin, and you can judge for yourself whether you&#39;ve got the alignment wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly if you just have a little bit of a board around the edge of nothingness, then it, anything will work. You only need one. You don&#39;t need two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyway. I put it down as a problem. I didn&#39;t explain that. Yeah. Just because you could have them missing, and I had it missing. I forgot the social media on somebody&#39;s site and they were going, oh, it looks really awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course what it does is it takes the first thing in the dom, which was actually a mega menu in our case, a tiny image in it. It was so I had to put a generic one in there. But, yeah. we&#39;ll move into that more. Let&#39;s talk about the. Technical, SEO. So just a little bit about what we might wanna include in our head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;ve, robots is probably something that we might want to have a met name of robots so we can control the. Search engines crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; try to control no real control of that at all. But yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you are onto something there. Let me just go over here. There is ours, sorry for those who are just listening, but you&#39;ll, you&#39;ve got loads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting. I&#39;ve just done it and, it&#39;ll be close to your heart here, but you&#39;ll see here that I&#39;m disallowing. Claude Bot,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon bot. Oh, interesting. All the ai I&#39;m trying do you for a minute imagine that they&#39;re gonna honor that. Do you think, for example, chat, GPT bot is gonna come along and go, oh, disallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Fine. We&#39;ll disallow it. That&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve got that and I&#39;ve also got robots written in their head as well, saying No AI as well. okay. These are my two things. It&#39;ll be fascinating to, I, I dunno if I&#39;ll know, but I, certainly do see. On a lot of my sites that it&#39;s used on a lot more server resources now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; did you see that CloudFlare have been taking steps, about this because they obviously don&#39;t believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the declaration there, disallow, for example, chat, GPT or what have you, they&#39;re obviously not taking that seriously because they&#39;ve got this, new thing where they&#39;re going, to basically drop traffic and they govern about 20% of the web. So they&#39;ve got fairly sharp teeth, but, they&#39;re either going to tie them up in a kind of like an endless loop of content, which you know, is not real, but is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of, it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not actually what they want to consume or they&#39;re just gonna drop the traffic unless you pay them. I dunno if you caught sight of any of that, but I definitely wouldn&#39;t be trusting these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I got it from your other show. I wouldn&#39;t have known about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Yeah, it did amuse me, but yes, same as you. I&#39;m. I&#39;m not sure if I want another big megacorp to help me with the problems of other mega corps,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; a good way of encapsulating it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Maybe Cloud Flow is our friend now, but who knows what they&#39;ll be in a decade&#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Anyway, there we go. That was the robots one. Where are we next? Canonical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Canonical. Yeah, it, which confuses me. This, oh, I&#39;ve got robots twice on my list here, but that&#39;s, oh, that&#39;s okay. Yes. It should be so canonical. You&#39;ve got two ways of ex exclude to avoid the duplicate content issue. And duplicate content issue isn&#39;t something you get penalized by with the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s, it&#39;s just that for, you want to be listed for the right. Direction to that content, don&#39;t you? So C canonical tags are a good way, or the other way is to go with, and this is written wrong on my notes, so I&#39;ll change it. A MET data that&#39;s saying this content is no index or something. So you, yeah, So just to ignore it if it is a duplicate. So they&#39;re quite key things. I&#39;ve got canonical working and it. To be honest, it&#39;s a bit of a mess. Maybe we&#39;ll look at it in the next, session. &#39;cause I have to put all this programming in to make sure that when we&#39;ve got all these separate pages that I dynamically created with the system, that I had something that was changing my, data there to, read that out as a different page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh gosh. Yeah. So it got, it can get quite complex. Probably It&#39;s a lot easier sometimes just to Okay. Say, index, and then the one I didn&#39;t even know about, It&#39;s just doing this research on their ones, the alternative language for X on that, for internet, again, it&#39;s another duplicate content thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;re supposed to really specify which language you&#39;re primarily in. Also. Otherwise, you can get duplicate content issues with that if you&#39;ve got different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So for example, if a page is in, is once in Italian, once in English, once in Spanish, and what have you, is to declare it with this alternative language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I think so. So you can end up with some problems there. Okay. And finally, this&#39;s, just the other one that we needed to put in, which is again, a link, alternative, which is leading to where your feed pages, if you&#39;ve got RSS feeds, which we do in this, we do. there was something interesting I do think from the technical SEO side of things, and I, did a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used, this was a deal about ages back because it&#39;s quite expensive. There&#39;s a web auditor, which is I remember that. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And there is a, an alternative for partly free screaming frog&#39;s, SEO spider, where you can crawl your pages. So I did this. Recently, and because I didn&#39;t put forward slashes on some of my addresses in my head, I got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many 3 0 1 redirects, but I have, sorry, again, to those people who are viewing this, I did actually put, there is a link there that shows our results on this. So it&#39;s quite, useful to, to see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; where there are issues. sorry, was that a, an, was that a missing? Trailing forward slash at the end of the url?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so yes, no script show and often I&#39;ve put that in the dynamic URLs without the trailing slash but our setup automatically goes to the trailing slash so when I put it in there, it&#39;s having to do this redirect every time. Okay. Got it. Which is obviously going to have some slight impact on the user because it means their browser has to do more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I again, haven&#39;t given that enough thought, but I will give that enough thought. But it&#39;s one of those things that when you paste the URL without the trailing slash, it looks more human readable. So let&#39;s say you paste that link into an email or something like that where you know it&#39;s being consumed by eyeballs, then you have the intuition that it&#39;ll look better if it&#39;s not got a training slash, or at least I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But obviously then the browser has to do work to say, wait, no. Add it. Okay. Yeah. Good to know. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; our setup is to always have the trailing slasher, which I think is pretty much the same in most WordPress if you automatically put it in. Yeah. And it&#39;s probably taking care on that, but with me doing it myself manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Yeah. I left them off and I create a whole bunch of issues here. But yeah, I think these tools are pretty good. obviously this. Premium thing, and I was lucky to get some deal earlier on, but it does a really good job of picking out all the sort of silly redirects that you can get as a source of your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are some errors which are showing on here, but I&#39;ll just tell you that this is a bot error. So it&#39;s saying it can&#39;t find something, and it&#39;s also saying there&#39;s some broken links, but in natural fact, it&#39;s the bot, it&#39;s, CloudFlare protecting me. Oh, from, the bot crawling my email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Okay. I can well understand why they&#39;re doing that. Yeah. Okay. Swings and roundabouts with CloudFlare today then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So they&#39;re doing a good job there, but they are showing me errors on there, but that was, yeah. So we&#39;ve tied it up our head a little bit now. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve always had a fairly messy head, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, now I&#39;m feeling as if I&#39;ve had a qua. I&#39;ve had a, I&#39;ve had a smart haircut and a buffing up. No, that&#39;s really interesting. That&#39;s great. Just. For the people who are listening to this once more, if you wanna follow the bits and pieces that David has put on that page, it&#39;s gonna amend the few things I think probably that he said needed amending no script show slash 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then in a few moments from now, David and I are going to record a, visual version where David goes through this in more detail on the screen, so less audio, more video, and you&#39;ll be able to find that. no script show slash learn slash 14 with a trailing slash I might add. but it looks better like that, so I&#39;m leaving it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. You&#39;ll be able to find that as well. So there&#39;ll be some, addendum to this content. Is that it? Have we done for this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. then, we&#39;ll, we&#39;re gonna look at the head now as a component in a bit of code that the way it&#39;s set up actually on our site. I just thought it&#39;s quite interesting what, Where the series might go actually. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Honestly, there was like, that&#39;s 1 0 1 basic stuff that we&#39;ve just covered, and I knew way less than 30% of it. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I was just, I, was flushing red all the way through reading this stuff, putting it together, going, oh my god. Basic, stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so in which case we will, we&#39;ll pause the recording there and, we&#39;ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re listening to the audio, if not, come and join us for the video. See you in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better HTML head tags</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/14/" />
    <updated>2025-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/14/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our chat with Paul Lacey on &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/22/&quot;&gt;design systems&lt;/a&gt; we are looking at the head element on the No Script Show. How it is set up could be the start of our own design system.  Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our site is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. You can reach head code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.dev/DavidWaumsley/NoScriptShow/blob/main/_includes/partials/head.njk&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is created with Eleventy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;) and uses nunjuck templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re creating small components containing links to code resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to include cut and paste snippets and quality checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/optimized-head/&quot;&gt;Optimal head structure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/favicons/&quot;&gt;Favicons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/social-metadata/&quot;&gt;Social metadata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show. This is a video follow up from our podcast, episode 23 that was called Are We Right In the Head? You can find that at no script show slash 2 3 23. Here though we&#39;re looking at the code used in the no script shows, head tag and links for what we are showing over at No Script Show slash Learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward slash 14. So one four. I&#39;ll put that link on the screen in a moment. So if you are watching this on YouTube or something like that, you&#39;ll be able to get that. But, hello David. How are you doing? Hello? I&#39;m good. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, we might as well bring the show notes up on this one straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. &#39;cause not many of them, we&#39;ll just go and look at our head here. in some ways. I think we&#39;re following up on that chat that we had last time with Paul Lacey on Design Systems, and we&#39;re trying to put something together that&#39;s a design system as we go through these components. And here I just thought I&#39;d share this kind of early start of how we&#39;re chopping up this site so people can look at it and go, either take inspiration from it or find errors with it and let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, which is, it&#39;s more likely to be the latter, but. So what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve put our site, which is an Eleventy site on GitHub. So I&#39;ll just go over there and you can poke around in the code that we have. So our site was taken from the Eleventy base blog, and I&#39;ve Been messing around with it since there, so lot&#39;s changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you go into, whether is that a link there to our repository and you go into, the include section into layouts and into partials, we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve got a head, nun jugs file over here and. When you&#39;re in here, you can actually go in there and use their own editor, which I&#39;ve done. So I&#39;ll go over to the page here and your setup might look slightly different &#39;cause you can bring in whatever extensions you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. But this is a dark mode and this is what I thought we&#39;ll try and do with the, as we get into sort of these sort of components, you wouldn&#39;t think of the head as a component. &#39;cause it&#39;s not a seam. But I&#39;m treating it like that and I&#39;m thinking. With our other site that we have, which we&#39;ve called the Intrinsic Framework, it&#39;s a jotting pad for bits of code that I might want to copy and paste, or as a way of checking that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I build new sites and do stuff. So I thought I would try and combine it and put it all in this one document here, into the section and then put links into it. as we were talking about in the first audio session on this, talking about heads, we were influenced by Harry. Robert&#39;s, talk, which was saying how you can structure your header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve got a link here, so anyone can just go and follow the link here and bring up the details here that we&#39;ve got here. Now, this will just be a. running document as somebody has someone kindly listened to our, episode on, accordions and we had a, an issue that I&#39;d never solved in the CSS, which was about the little triangles on the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And that you couldn&#39;t hide it from safari. And this person came back with a. The solution. So there was a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; way of doing it. Very nice. There&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; was, so the same is for anybody else who might wanna listen to this here. as we&#39;re learning as we go with all of this. So I&#39;ve just put in here, I mean it&#39;s worth just taking a quick look because we skimmed over in the audio session about Harry Roberts talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the link so you can listen to him. It&#39;s about an hour long, I think. And there is this sort of, Guide here to what you might want. So I only mentioned the certain things that we use, but this is the exact order that you suggest that we put things in. So it includes other things that we, might not have mentioned where you might put pre connect, where you might put a synchronous JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;ve got none of that running in our site, where we might put the import. So there&#39;s all the order there and that&#39;s formed the basis of when I&#39;m putting something in the head, I&#39;ll look at this first and go, which order is it going to go on? Where we&#39;re gonna put it in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; our head? I, suppose that&#39;s immutable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not really gonna change over time. That document is it. what you see there is, gonna be until some major thing happens that&#39;s gonna be good for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I would&#39;ve thought so. Unless, something changes in there. I, guess things are changing all the time. a lot of these pre connects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, I just wonder, I haven&#39;t got a policy yet, but I think with all the, I forgot what it&#39;s called. Synchronous loading. Is it called that you might remember I just mentioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you, are you talking about the CSF, the acronym of the. And No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m talking about the fact that you can preload, pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; synchronous loading was what we said synchronous. I can&#39;t remember. Let&#39;s go with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s the Google thing. It seems it&#39;s only in Google at the moment, but it might take off and that might change maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh no, you are thinking of. Speculative loading. That&#39;s the one. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; knew it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; wrong. Yeah. So that might change things like here, where you mark things up, but otherwise That&#39;s a good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; point. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also, for those who didn&#39;t see the, those who did listen to the audio and listening to this, one thing I didn&#39;t mention is about schema markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause I was a little bit, because it&#39;s a kind of script in there, but I assumed it would follow. His rule that you generally put all your urgent stuff at the top of your head. At the top. Yeah. Yeah. Those three key things that we need, like the, the page title, that we, need something on our view ports over there and that we need a character set on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pretty much when we get to the CSS and the JavaScript, there&#39;s an order depending on how they load. But the one thing that I hadn&#39;t thought about, &#39;cause it&#39;s not mentioned in this talk, was about. Uses schema markup because it&#39;s contained in the script. Where does that go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it, I, double checked it and, I assumed it would go in with your SEO, which should be, that&#39;s last, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Unless it&#39;s the title. Everything that&#39;s SEO goes last in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and that&#39;s the case here, because it&#39;s not synchronous. Scripting as such, it&#39;s, it&#39;s not gonna hold anything back, so it can go last,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; on that. I&#39;m just gonna quickly read into the podcast if you&#39;re, watching this, the, the audio podcast that we had the notes for that were at this url, so no script show slash 23 2 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it at the top, but I&#39;ll. Put it on the screen and then the bits and pieces for this one, no script show forward slash learn slash 1 4 14. Okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; there we go. Yeah, so we&#39;re just following on there and I&#39;ve put the key points that we got from this talk over here just as a quick reminder about the important things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, his orders really useful. So that is, something that I&#39;ve put in my document over here, as a way to link to it, just to refresh myself on it. But our own head, in some ways it violates, we were talking about before. I&#39;m using Eleventy here, which allows you to bundle together all of these individual CSS files into one which I&#39;m using here, and I&#39;m using a link tag over here, which is doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is an argument that you could use this and. The Eleventy Base blog actually does that. It outputs it by default as it into your head. Okay. The whole CSS goes there, which is interesting because according to Harry Roberts, you could, it could be CSS that you could put in the body in effect, but, as another place to put it, So that was the main thing. So this has structured the order of things that I&#39;ve put in, but there were other things that we talked about in our audio episode, so I put some links up to this. So something on the fons here. and yeah, we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; talked about them being SV Gable, didn&#39;t we? Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; From Safari 26, which is only out in towards the end of June, I think 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone listening to this a lot later and. Because of this. I think it&#39;s a, real game changer in the sense that we can now have these SVG icons as I understand it. I dunno if you remember, there was a conversation I was having where I wanted to link to an SVG and put. prefers color scheme within that SVG and for the browsers to honor that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I didn&#39;t have to put that SVG in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So I could change things. I don&#39;t know if this changes that, because it was the only browser safari that didn&#39;t do it. So I&#39;m wondering whether we now have to put in line SVGs to build up, to have. It prefers color scheme. You had to, and maybe this is gonna be a change that I haven&#39;t looked into it, but I can show you this in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, let me just quickly go over this documentation. let&#39;s just have a look here. So there are a few things that we obviously want to still put in here that we&#39;ve got our SVG that&#39;s the most important now supported up to. Roughly 78% of the moment increasing. I think as things change with Safari, we still need our fabric on ICO, which of course a fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. Supported by everything that goes back forever. we may want to include, something for apple touch screens, so ping on that one. I&#39;ve done that and I haven&#39;t bothered with the progressive web app. Link on that one at all with ours. But the light and dark is quite interesting because this is literally the one we&#39;re using on our fon at the moment on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just so I can show you it, as you can see within there, we&#39;ve got, in the Fon we&#39;ve put a style sheet on here, and then we&#39;ve got a media query changing the bars and the brackets. Of our icon here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, if you change our scheme here, this isn&#39;t working because there has to be a separate setup for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is using,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right? Because that&#39;s not the fcon. It&#39;s not, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s, this is one of the most awkward things I think about light and dark at moment. We can&#39;t just rely on. Having preferred color scheme on CSS, we have to build something in separate to make that work. And we can add this in, but I haven&#39;t added it in for preferred color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So our is working on other attributes, but if I go, and actually I&#39;ll leave it here because I&#39;ve got this little tool on here, which will change without me having to go into the settings I have. Oh yeah, you&#39;ve got a little chrome extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Look at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that. Yes, I have. So I could see, it&#39;s working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if I set my browser or device, you can see it&#39;s changing the colors here. So I think that&#39;s pretty cool. So that&#39;s pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So our Fon, which we&#39;re using on our site, I dunno if you can see, I&#39;m pointing over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, just about. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s on there. But I needed to make it big. So you can see that there&#39;s a really good article actually, on Fons here, but it goes into real depth about, the kind of sizes that you might want for your ICO image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I haven&#39;t bothered with any of that &#39;cause I think it&#39;s. It&#39;s like the, it&#39;s some relic of the past, isn&#39;t it? it&#39;s hopefully it will be soon. I think we&#39;ll all be on s vg, so that makes sense. So anyway, it&#39;s just some little notes there on that. let me just go back to my head code over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. And the next thing that was worth talking about was the social media. I&#39;ve set up a page as well for that, on the intrinsic framework and just worth mentioning this, I think, Because it&#39;s quite a lot of code to have to put in. I think the simplest way, if you&#39;re just doing a brochure site, and this is what I&#39;ve done on some sites where you&#39;re not expecting much to get shared on social media, maybe your about page, really, you don&#39;t need to replicate all of the options that you&#39;ve got for open graph and Twitter where you know you&#39;re asked for your description and your titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t have them, it&#39;s gonna take the site&#39;s title and description and use that anyway. So the only thing that we want to probably stop is it&#39;s showing the first image in the do or whatever image, the social media. because that could be any&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; random thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. Which is inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, as we talked about before, you could set up one social image if you put enough. Probably about 15% of us border around a, an aspect ratio image of about, 16 nine. 16 nine, something like that. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And that&#39;s gonna work for all of them. I tend to put them, I think at the moment you, need, for sort of the best arrangement, you need something that&#39;s over 1200 pixels, but I just tend to use 1920 and use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web P, it&#39;s so small, it doesn&#39;t make any difference that size difference. They&#39;re,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; they&#39;re so close. The Twitter one really just seems to shave a little bit off the top and the bottom. That&#39;s on a tiny bit off the side. The aspect ratio is such that if you just add a, like you said, 15% of just white space, for one of a better word, everything will be inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of them easily. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; think it&#39;s, Facebook&#39;s the one that cuts it slightly short of it, and it&#39;s, oh, I thought it was the other way round. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&#39;s that way round and it just, yeah. Shakes a little bit off the bottom so you can protect against that. But the full HTML I&#39;ve put here where you can fit each of these, put your own unique titles that go for each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have, even though I&#39;ve made this dynamic, I&#39;ve put that in our head. But it&#39;s actually didn&#39;t need to be there &#39;cause it&#39;s just a repeat of what&#39;s in our default titles and description. But we could, I guess we could add. Hello Facebook user before them. Facebook. Yeah. Don&#39;t we just and then I&#39;ve put in just of interest because this is the same code that&#39;s in the dynamic sort of nun jug stuff that I&#39;ve set up for our site, which, I dunno how much interest that will hold, but I&#39;ll go over to, here and look at it &#39;cause it&#39;s the same and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we&#39;ve done on this. And same thing could be done on WordPress. In fact, I&#39;m thinking of replicating this in WordPress. The whole idea of this is that because I,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; nearly fell off my chair when I heard that in order. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I just thought, it&#39;d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; be probably a classic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; theme &#39;cause it&#39;s, Yes. but yeah, doing exactly the same thing. And also what I like about this, because, something I was mentioning to you earlier is that you can put all these notes in there and they&#39;re not going to be outputted into the source code. So if I go to source code, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s all tightly packed over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually if we&#39;re looking at here, I&#39;ve got these gaps. So as long as in nun jugs we use this comin system and put a little dash. Buy it takes away the space that it occupies so we can put in as many notes as we like in our system instructions. And so I quite like it. It&#39;s the perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; commenting system in that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, exactly. As much as you like. And it&#39;s never gonna appear in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. So all my instructions, idiot. Do this in your head tag is basically, that&#39;s one I&#39;m setting up trying to set up quality control and mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is usually the URL where I stole the bit of code that&#39;s about to follow it. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; down the,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s basically the same really. I&#39;m just linking out to where the stolen code that I&#39;m putting in there. but yeah, there&#39;s quite an interesting conditionals go on here. It may not be so much of interest, but what we have going on here is that, We have something to say in here if what we&#39;re using is the YouTube&#39;s own thumbnail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we finish this recording, it&#39;ll go on YouTube, we&#39;ll have a thumbnail with it. And instead of having to provide for social media, for other social media, our own image which we have to store, I&#39;m simply just taking. The one that&#39;s already there with Google and output in it. So that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; little video ID inside the URL there becomes the video ID and thereby therefore, that makes that URL work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. It&#39;s a web, image, wherever that destination is, and you just need to supply the video ID and the exactly drops in there like a merge tag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; basically. So the page that we&#39;re looking on, the one where we put our notes for today at the moment will, because of the conditionals that we&#39;ve got here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I put in the video ID something I&#39;ve made myself in my front matter for this page and given it right the id, then it&#39;s going to output the content and that image over here. If I haven&#39;t done that, there is another option, which we haven&#39;t actually used. But if I&#39;ve got something which I&#39;ve called a featured image that could be showing, That would also be showing on our page as well. And if not, and what&#39;s presently showing, if someone can see the show notes before we put the video, it will be showing our generic, one that we use for about and homepage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right? So the syntax there is, you&#39;ve got the, video idea is the preferred way, but then you&#39;ve got a fallback with your else if, or l if as it&#39;s described there, which is gonna be the featured image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, you&#39;ll set that somewhere as. Possible fallback, and then if neither of those get us supplied, then it just falls back to some the OG image of the. Site. Yeah. Of the entire site. Got it. Okay. that&#39;s really, I like that. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s, yeah, so it&#39;s quite nice to be able to set these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course you can do the same thing we were talking as well, about, let me just go back over a few things. There are a few preloads that we&#39;ve put in over here. one of those actually a little bit complicated unless you saw as. Setting this up before, but we haven&#39;t done anything about setting up the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, with Eleventy, if the layout is one of the posts here and it&#39;s got the video id, the thing that I&#39;ve set up, then it will preload that image here. So it on our pages, it shows quickly. So when we go to those episodes page, that image is coming in from Google. But I want it to preload as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So that&#39;s an, if without a fallback. That one to just, if it&#39;s there, great. Yeah. Do something. It&#39;s there, preload it. If not, just move,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; chill out. Yeah, Exactly. And that&#39;s, the fonts are being preloaded, that&#39;s all. the SEO this, I mentioned this in the audio, that there&#39;s, it&#39;s, belt and braces really with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is a robots, text file that&#39;s in there listing all of the. AI that we don&#39;t want to come. There was many. There was many. And there&#39;s this one which I&#39;ve put in as well. I dunno how effective it is, but there we are. There&#39;s a canonical. I think probably I&#39;ve covered that. Is there anything else that sort of No, that all seems eye on this, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no. If I&#39;m following that through, that all seems about right. Yeah. I can&#39;t see anything that you scroll past that you didn&#39;t mention. So that was it. It was just a little, anyway, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; just thought it was probably worth just showing our own site and now I&#39;ve put it public. I&#39;ll try and build little sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can follow along and see and take inspiration or find, as I say, if they can find things that we can make better, then great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, please let us know. I, I think that&#39;s the shortest piece of content we&#39;ve ever made of any kind. we&#39;re just over 21 minutes. What the heck? life is not normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That&#39;s interesting. so just a quick reminder. Because I might as well get another minute out of this and get it up to 22 minutes. The, if you want to hear the podcast episode that goes with this, you can probably find it on YouTube as well. But here we go. No script show slash 23. Numbers two, three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if you wanna find the, links, which David has just been demonstrating in this one. No script show slash learn slash 1 4 14. That&#39;s it. Is it is. Okay in that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we might take a small break. Just, we might not be back, because there&#39;s a few things that are happening where there&#39;s me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming over to your country, Nathan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; my country. That&#39;s right. Yeah. I very much feel the ownership of that country. It&#39;s a heavy burden. I do like to help the king out from time to time and, yeah, that&#39;d be nice. And also you&#39;ve got nice things happening in your life as well, which, maybe we&#39;ll get into at some point in a, an entirely different podcast series, or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, David. Thank you. Take it easy. Bye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. For the last couple of episodes, we&#39;ve been looking at components that make up a website. In doing that, we are building a library that we can refer to, particularly for the next time we build demo websites on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be considered a part of a design system, but apart from knowing this is a hot topic, we&#39;re not sure what a design system is to try and unpack this, we&#39;re delighted to be joined once again by our friend Paul Lacey. He, unlike us, has actually managed to put some form of design system together for his own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apart from my usual, hello to David Wamsley. Hello, David Wamsley. Hello. I&#39;m gonna also, yeah, thank you. I&#39;m also gonna say hello to Paul Lacey. Lovely. Hello. Now that we&#39;ve got the introductions out of the way, Paul, I just a second because our listeners, if they haven&#39;t heard a previous episode, they won&#39;t know who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m gonna put you on the spot. Give us your potted bio quickly, if that&#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:01] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;re correct to first of all say I&#39;ve done some form of a system, so I&#39;m glad you said that. also, I&#39;m not a full, on expert in this. I&#39;m much like yourselves just knowing about it, see and aware that I&#39;m doing some aspects of it, interested how I can improve it myself, and looking to see where things are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know David does a lot more probably academic study of this sort of thing because when we talk, I know he&#39;s read books on it, which I haven&#39;t. And, but yeah, so what I am a web designer developer, probably started around 1999, I think it was. I&#39;ve seen a lot of change from the, using, non breakable spaces for design for instead of, CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I started, there wasn&#39;t really any CSS right at the beginning. There probably was, but we weren&#39;t using it at the beginning. Then CSS comes in and then the.com boom and burst and all that sort of stuff. And then I think we&#39;re still. We&#39;re still recovering from that now, just in terms of how the whole western world seems to think what web design is or should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this whole design system thing is called because it&#39;s lays down some rules that if we all, if everybody got on board and followed it, it would make for much better websites, I think. And, but where we are, I think these days is that certain level of organizations are good at, dealing, implementing these things and running them because everybody&#39;s on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then as you go down and organizations get smaller, you get to a point where, the web designers are on board with these sort of things, but perhaps not everybody else is. So it&#39;s a real challenge to figure out how you can have these systems in your mind and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there are lots of factors that can derail these sort of things. So I&#39;m hoping that we might get to the bottom of some of that today. we might not even get as far of defining what all this stuff is, but we&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, indeed. So as is always the case, David has put together some show notes, which I&#39;ll share on the screen, but you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh that didn&#39;t work out so well. There we go. You can find them at no script show and then slash the number 2, 2 22. So no script show slash 22. Shall we should we pop that on the screen, David and crack on and I&#39;ll basic hand the bat on over to you at this point, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s only basic notes so we can try and get some definitions &#39;cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you say, I read some books on this stuff. I, when I read articles and I hear terms like design systems used in different contexts, I don&#39;t know what people are meaning by it. There&#39;s other things like, DI design tokens, I dunno what that means. And there&#39;s different definitions out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought it&#39;d be good to chat because Paul and I have had some conversations before. &#39;cause it&#39;s the holy grail to try and find some way, particularly if you&#39;re just working on your own, to efficiently create your own websites and backing out. WordPress days, we&#39;ve always tried to get some starter website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&#39;s go. I, put a couple of definitions up there, which may be Nathan, you&#39;ll need to read because I&#39;m on a very small screen and I can&#39;t read what I&#39;ve written. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; fine. Yeah. So again, I&#39;m reading off the screen, no script do show forward slash 22, and the, headline for that is, are design systems worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we&#39;re gonna begin by asking the question, what do we mean by design systems? There&#39;s a couple of quotes, which I&#39;ll just read out. The first one says, A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns. And I can, that&#39;s the Norman Nielsen or Nielsen Norman, I can never remember group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then a source. From Figma, the design tool, a design system is a single source of truth that reduces design redundancy and accelerates the development process. So I guess they&#39;re broadly similar in a way. Do you want me to read the other bits about the, who uses a design system, or should we dwell on the, what do we mean first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, I like these definitions. I don&#39;t know about you, Paul, because they&#39;re, pretty vague. So under this definition, what you&#39;ve been doing with the page builder that you&#39;ve used, you&#39;ve created this whole system to be able to put together websites through these kind of row templates, haven&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can do that and there&#39;s nothing there that would say, that&#39;s not a design system, I don&#39;t think. And you could argue even what we&#39;re trying to do at the moment, which is, it&#39;s interesting because our series that we&#39;ve done before, I was model it on the idea of what you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, in a way was thinking, okay, what I want to do is to have not necessarily row templates because I&#39;m working much more with grid and, my page layouts might be different, but the fact that I thought I needed something so I could grab this bit here and have a header here to here about, a middle section, some, accordions and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&#39;ve gone on, you realize for, us, that a component ends up being an examination of what the HTML and CSS options are when you are constructing something. It doesn&#39;t turn out to be something I can easily drag and drop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So does that, when you say that, so obviously rows, we understand what that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That usually represents from the left to the right of the screen and it&#39;s a horizontal block of stuff. But a component is the, bits, if you like, that might sit with inside that. But are you saying then that the component, when you really get to it and you do this work over and over again, you realize that even that sort of definition and clarification doesn&#39;t work because it might be that you want to take out a little bit with within that component itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so really what you are forcing yourself to do is forget how it looks, forget the bit that you could drag and drop onto the canvas for want of a better word. You are saying worry about the actual code that makes that up. That&#39;s the component. The ht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. we started ourselves trying to do the accordion and straight away we realized that where the accordion is used and what we expected to do, so we&#39;d have to have a whole series of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in terms of us getting some sort of design system was really a. But we&#39;re putting together something as part of our series, which ends up being nothing more than a few sort of bullet points about how this will work for accessibility, when this is appropriate to use, and not that is more useful than the drag and drop component itself, So it&#39;s been quite interesting, our own attempt to build a design system, which gets more naughty the. The more you get into it. But anyway, sorry. I, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m gonna keep this going if you don&#39;t mind. &#39;cause I think this is interesting because the word design by definition, I think is the use of the, I, at least in my head, I&#39;m, imagining what I can see more than anything else, as in what is put on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously you&#39;ve got tools like Figma, that&#39;s their bread and butter, isn&#39;t it? Is what is the whole point of that tool is to create things that you can send to people and you can see it. But what you are saying is that for you, that definition, you&#39;ve gotta atomize it a little bit further and go, into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it might be that, okay, there is an accordion, you can see that&#39;s fine. But because of the various different ways you could use an accordion, it might not look the same each time. And design system already we&#39;re we&#39;ve come against some trip wires because I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s what you look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it, and not really, that doesn&#39;t live up to the definition you&#39;ve just described of code. So that&#39;s interesting. I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s quite interesting. If you look at the design systems, well-known design systems that are out there, like there is, the material design system by Google. there is, there&#39;s Nord Health there, there have a big design system, which is perhaps more about the look of things that you might bring in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then when you start to look at, I think interestingly there&#39;s been a move, if you look at the, there&#39;s design systems as well for the UK government, so there&#39;s one that will go with gov UK and is now the same with us as well. And when you look at those, they. There, there will be, there&#39;s elements about their own, but they&#39;re very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;their public sites have to be design-wise, quite simplistic. But there, when you look at it, it&#39;s often seems to be a lot more about the rules about how to make this particular thing accessible. it&#39;ll be, and it, gets much more closer to the component of the design system, if you like, is really the raw H two ML, Okay. More often or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Paul, do you wanna do any more on that before we move on to the next section?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:04] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sure. The, definitions, I much prefer the n nng one with a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just &#39;cause it just, It just gels with me a little bit better. I would like, personally in my life, I would remove the word complete and it would be a set of standards. And I, because it has the word intended, I like that. &#39;cause it&#39;s, saying that we&#39;re trying to do this rather than the, other definition from Figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that will definitely ring, will definitely vibe well with UX and ui, designers who use that Figma product. I think, this whole concept is a single source of truth that reduces design, redundancy, accelerates development of process, et cetera. I just, what comes to mind with all this sort of stuff is that the, whole concept of design system can turn a lot of people off immediately because it immediately goes, sounds technical and immediately sounds like, ex exclusionary to people who don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m thinking, when you take any of the companies that we might have mentioned, If anyone who&#39;s not a designer or developer and not thinking about the HML or these, global colors or variables and stuff like that, it&#39;s are we even part of this conversation? So if you take the actual, the end user audience, how can someone in the audience or the audience of a website contribute to a com conversation and feedback on the design system and how well it&#39;s used being used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can HR feedback on that? How can CEOs feedback on that sort of thing? So I quite like the NNG one because it&#39;s more open also, I know we don&#39;t have it up on the screen, but the, looking at the, a couple of those, design systems, David, that you highlighted. I really do the, Gov uk, the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;design system. because it, it&#39;s accommodated everybody that needs to understand it. It&#39;s, given the code. It gives you the code snippets and it shows you what you should be doing on that level. But the way it communicates about its design system, patterns or components is in human language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whereas the three of us might talk about, we need a design system for an accordion, what&#39;s the point of the accordion? whereas the UK government website tends to say things like, here is a, design system for when you need to get somebody&#39;s credit card details for them to pay a bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, so it gives you the kind of point of why you would even care about this. And so then the finance department is saying. Oh, this sounds good. So we&#39;ve got a more efficient way to get the money from people who owe the money, or we also have included in that design system a way for them to, present to the user what to do if they have a problem paying this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so everybody&#39;s benefiting that, the different departments are understanding where, what the point is for them. what&#39;s in it for me in the finance department to be, to care about this design system that, Dan from head of Design was going on about in that meeting that I was falling asleep in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I really liked that because, and that this is maybe why, if you&#39;ve struggled to get started yourselves, it might be because. why it might be easier for me is because I don&#39;t have to worry about the HTML too much because I&#39;ve essentially made a decision to not care about it as much, which I know some, if somebody might listen to this and be like, what the heck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what kind of professional are you? But essentially, I&#39;m living in the world where I need to use WordPress themes and WordPress page builders, and a bunch of those decisions are taken away from me. So I&#39;m straight into the point where I&#39;m thinking about, I&#39;ve got a decision, I&#39;ve got two options at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can go straight into thinking about the elements that I want. So do I want a row, let&#39;s say with, a call to action in it and those sort of things? Or do I, do, I go into purpose led thinking, which is what I&#39;ve been trying to do more recently. Essentially, it&#39;s the same stuff, but the, purpose again, of a pricing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you start with the purpose and it is to present the. options and recommend an option to a user. So how do we present the options of our product and recommend which one is probably right for them? And if we think about it from that angle, then we&#39;ve in, we&#39;ve included into our design system, the point of the element or the pattern or the component, and then we work backwards from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then eventually. You can take that, rationale of why you need this component and you can stop at the point that&#39;s comfortable for me, I stop at the point where I&#39;m dragging these elements in and designing them in Beaver Builder. Whereas if you want, you can go further back and ditch that, aspect and get, and then go, we know the point of it, we know what the users want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know what HML tags we might need as opposed to just looking at some other, I&#39;m not saying you do this, looking at some pricing tables and seeing what elements appear to be there and then coding those up. So you&#39;ve always got, like the government, UK government website has, you&#39;ve always got this design component or this component or pattern can, be measured as failing or SU succeeding because there is a mission for it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I dunno if any of that made sense, but that&#39;s, That&#39;s where the two strict ones, like the Figma one to me is, a, I&#39;m reading it and thinking that this is less inclusive as the one above it from NNG because the NNG one is talking about its managing design at scale. It&#39;s reusing components and patterns, and it&#39;s intending to improve that process rather than be a kind of, elitist sort of set of Figma documents that nobody else understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you don&#39;t know, and if you come in as a designer to our team and you don&#39;t know what this is, gosh, what&#39;s wrong with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I try to just encapsulate what you&#39;ve just said, I think in one sentence? no, It&#39;s no. But in order to just clarify in my head. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So I think what you just said then would be something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;d have a Paul Lacey quote on that page, and it would say something like, A design system is a text description of design of the purpose. Of design elements, visual design elements, which are reusable, scalable components and what have you. So it&#39;s, got that kind of description bit in text as the focus, like the Gov UK one that you were describing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah. And because you&#39;ve described its purpose, you&#39;ve made it more accessible to people who don&#39;t have a, a background in graphic design for want of a better word, because you&#39;ve, explained what its point is on the page. Is that about right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:26] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it means that you could have a conversation with the finance department that Informs how you should make this, these components and patterns that fit into your design system. like further down this document is probably some stuff about the ingredients of a design system. Like the finance department doesn&#39;t need to contribute too much about the brand colors. In fact, they don&#39;t need to contribute about that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they probably don&#39;t need to. I forget what it&#39;s called. There&#39;s, the components, the patterns, there&#39;s, the really little things. They&#39;re like the variables. What are those called? tokens. Tokens. So that stuff is to me, for the, brand and the design team to know that, green means go, red means stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amber might mean, think about it, blue means information. they might make those sort of decisions based on the brand and, but the, actual HML elements that, so the HML feels that it&#39;s more of a, it&#39;s more of a human conversation with, the, stakeholders and then the brand element is more of an internal design, creative, side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but yeah, I think Nathan, what you more or less said, is, probably a better definition just, for me because, I&#39;m, I have to have conversations with clients all the time and I have to try and justify why I&#39;ve done something and I can&#39;t just say, because Figma told me to, based on their amazing design system As such, no, no offense to Figma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. but to make it c communicable to who? The people I&#39;m trying to convince to not have a slider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; David, should we move on? Or If you&#39;ve got things to Yeah, let&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, we can actually, because we can widen it up. I think once we&#39;ve covered some of the points we&#39;ve put down here, so we&#39;ve just quickly, who uses a design system? So I mean there&#39;s, I guess there&#39;s two different types in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the large sites that need consistency as they keep changing their website, regardless of who&#39;s employed at the time. So they need some. Set of rules, if you like, about how this, the styling and the content is added to a particular style to a site. And then we&#39;ve got the, people like us, maybe were solo designers or maybe small groups and that who want quick ways to assemble websites and might use a design system like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s where you might, borrow something that&#39;s already existing out there. nor, or the material design or something from Google as a starting point, or effectively even as a lot of us do, we use a, it&#39;s not exactly a design system, but effectively it gets close to it. Something like Bootstrap becomes a design system tailwind, they become, even though they&#39;re CSS based, they become a sort of design system we can borrow, And then of course, and then the big question about design systems, and that&#39;s why you see a lot of debates about, you don&#39;t need a design system, you&#39;re wasting your time with it. And those people who say you absolutely do need a design system. And I think this is where you hear all these different conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause everybody has a different idea about what that might mean to them. So you if you invest too much, you can invest. As I&#39;ve done before, invested a lot of time trying to copy Paul and what he managed to do with his Beaver builder. I&#39;m so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:01] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m so sorry. We&#39;ll have led to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but I&#39;m just trying to do the same thing when we were both using the same page builder. Yeah. And I was trying to do the same thing as you, and you actually managed to get something that was useful, that worked for the jobs that you needed to do. I was envious of that when I started doing something in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got myself so caught up in. Sort of little elements. And the same thing has exactly happened in this series as well. When you get into components that I talk myself out of ever getting a system that works. but maybe one day I&#39;ll get there and it&#39;d be very thorough and it will work for me, but it&#39;s quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m definitely in that. Gotta invest in the right thing for the job that I&#39;m doing. I think you&#39;ve balanced that, right? And I, that&#39;s why this interests me how, to do it for us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anyway. Sorry, I&#39;m going off a bit there. That&#39;s okay. No, that&#39;s fine. So this is, the section who uses a design system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have we finished on that one? There&#39;s something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting on that. I just would say like the large sites that need consistency, regardless of who&#39;s working on them. This reminds me of my old, company that imploded Dicky Birds. this is why you should listen to me. I such success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it reminds me, &#39;cause, myself and my business partner both had different roles. we were working with totally different clients. my. Business partner Piera was working with a major, car manufacturer. One, the, one of the biggest ones in the world. And that was like our, probably our biggest client technically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was pretty much all he did, apart from a few other bits where he would contribute to some of the work I was doing. And I was working with SMEs and charities. And so we, we would argue actually when we collaborated on my projects, because his mindset was way more, long term than, mine. And I would be asking things of him that were borderline offensive to the way that he was learning to, he&#39;d learned to work, working as kind of part of a team at Nissan because essentially he was, he became integrated in the team and was leading UXs and UIs and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was a lot of separation. In these things, there was a lot of, rules and you couldn&#39;t break the rules because if you did, you would be, someone would hold you to account. And it&#39;s interesting &#39;cause you&#39;ve got those two first ones, large sites that needs con consistency. So we could say large companies or brands and then solo designers who want to assemble websites quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it&#39;s the lifespan of the design system for the large brand is basically infinite. It changes, but there&#39;s always a design system that is being used every single day. Whereas the web designers who are doing a client job, they might have a design system that&#39;s a lot looser than that, and they bring that design system into the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do the job, and then the design system essentially semi-retire. And the designer hopes that if the client goes off with that website that they carry on and try to make use of the systems that were put in place there. In most scenarios, they possibly don&#39;t. And that&#39;s why you have websites that launch and then they just degrade over time and become stale, and they lose the, initial, effectiveness that they might have had on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there&#39;s a lifespan that goes through these design systems that is very short with web designers. They have a drop in design system that doesn&#39;t use all the ingredients, but it helps &#39;em get the job done effectively and quickly then. Is gone. And the website just lives there. But with these big companies, the design system is part of every single decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nothing goes on the website unless it passes the design system. So it is just, we would argue, because I would say things like, I need a design for this by Friday, and it might be Tuesday already. And he would be like, so what do you want? Do you want, are you gonna give the UX to the client first? I was like, no, we just need to give them the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I&#39;d be, and I would be trying to, he&#39;d be saying, we&#39;re skipping the stage. And I&#39;d be saying, we&#39;re not skipping the stage. What we need to do is. Internalize that stage with our experience and just get it done and we need to use our experience to get the UX done. And he would say, no, we need to do the UX and get sign off on that before we&#39;re doing any design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would be saying, we will get fired. So it just is the kind of the friction and just like none of us were wrong in this. I was just, we were just living in different environment and he was right actually. And, but I was looking after the wellbeing of a company surviving in a, world that doesn&#39;t appreciate design systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. Should we move? Yeah, let&#39;s move on. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; The next section, once largely, I&#39;ve taken the main bullet points actually from an article that is, that I&#39;ve linked to, which is the Nielsen Norman Group one. So it&#39;s basically there, 1 0 1 on what is a design system. I did add something extra to this, which is design tokens, which is a term that&#39;s banded about, but what makes up a design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So largely it&#39;s got style guides, design tokens. You could argue that they overlap with each other, component libraries and maybe pattern libraries. That might be one way of breaking these things up. does that sound right to you, Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:45] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Do you know what, I didn&#39;t even know what design tokens was until I saw this a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to, I, understand what it is now. It&#39;s almost the technical layer between the brand guidelines or the style guide. So it could be like a CSS variable that is, saying, let&#39;s say a success variable. And that might be that the style guide informs that to be a green color highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So am I right about that? It&#39;s the,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I think it, it depends. I think the term comes from, I believe Salesforce and their own design system. And there&#39;s a particular, I think a name Gino and I&#39;ve forgotten their name, who&#39;s, really championed that. And she would very much see those as separate to, a CSS variable, where other people might see it as akin to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would see it as, do you know, can I step back and just, talk about why I think. This is interesting or where it gets confusing. &#39;cause I would think 2014 was such a significant year for, revitalizing the idea of getting, so you&#39;ve got this whole bunch of people. You had Brad Frost Atomic Design, which we talked about on this show, didn&#39;t we, Nathan before, which is, a way of thinking about how you build up a website out of Lego blocks, and at the same time you had reacts JavaScript component library appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got that whole way which you love your&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:17] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But these two things, without a doubt they influence, the future of things like Gutenberg for, WordPress. It was only in the next year when, Matt Mullen, we was talking about, blocks and the idea that JavaScript was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got that. At the same time, it was about the same year where you&#39;ve also got this. Country thing going with, I think gov uk it was the year that they won the only design award, national design award for a website before for going almost the completely opposite way with their own kind of design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think a lot of, when we talk about it, we have different ideas. So people think it&#39;s made up of, we&#39;re, thinking of react when we talk about components, people think of react even though there&#39;s web components. Yeah. Which predate it. So there are, I think that&#39;s why a lot of our, disagreements on what we think that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, design tokens is a word that I hate using because in a way, I don&#39;t know what I mean by it. It, I think that they would see it as one of Brad Frost&#39;s, the smaller atoms that make up a section of a website. but style guides, and this is where I think we mix things up because I think style guides is something that could stay, couldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a company for all time. When you try to realize those style guides, that&#39;s fine. They can be turned into CSS that you go by. But when it comes to the, there&#39;s a gap in here, I think, when it comes to the rest of the design, because you either take the view that you&#39;re making up with Lego blocks, these components, but then you&#39;re failing to see the designer as a whole If you work that way. and it&#39;s the same when you build pattern libraries. it&#39;s making an assumption that pattern will remain true for all time. Where I think we already know, technically this is very difficult as we see CSS particularly changing at the moment. it. the design system that I was working on, that you are working on is based around the fact that the only layout system we had for the web was Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have grid, it throws that out. Now we have container queries that throws it out soon. We are about to get into more things with, if statements where we might be able to program in all sorts of different types of arrangements for our website. So I do think, if you try to invest in a design system at the very technical level, it&#39;s very difficult at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could waste a lot of time, but style guides maybe are something that can remain in a company as you always use this particular color for your, your links and for your header and your photo or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ll just point out that if you, if you go to no script show slash 22, there&#39;s a couple of links on the what makes up a design system, section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them links out to, the Norman Nielsen Group as an article called Design Systems Versus Style Guides. And the other one, heads off to Figma, docs Token Studio, tokens Studio for Figma. So there&#39;s a couple of links provided by David there if you want to explore further. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we move on to the next bit? How do we get the design system? All right. Okay. Three options off the shelf, adapted from other sources or custom, I&#39;m guessing off the shelf, is what most people are gonna use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, I. I guess so. I dunno, we&#39;ve always tried to build and in effect, what Paul&#39;s done and what I&#39;ve always been trying to do as well, the same time was always a, to some degree off the shelf in the sense that we&#39;re, held to the platform that we, using there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got some restrictions that come with that. I do think it&#39;s interesting though, with things that change. I think with, when you get sonic off the shelf, you are trusting that company. So when you look at, there&#39;s been some huge errors with, material design. they totally broke the web&#39;s accessibility with forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decided that placeholders were a great thing to do and you can remove your titles from your form. making forms terrible for ages. Same with Bootstrap. It decided, bootstrap, I think four or something. It decided that. They were unsightly to underline our links, effectively breaking the site for whole, breaking the web for a whole bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do think, there is an issue when you look for off the shelf. Where can you, particularly as things change, particularly as we become more aware of getting back to the basis of the web, making sure that it is truly inclusive, that it does, look at accessibility. This is something that I think has grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t there so much back in 2014 when I think we had this resurgence of the idea that we could have great design systems. So I think now getting something off the shelf would be quite tricky unless, unless it was something I would get great ideas from, the UK Gov side or Gov UK side because you know that they, as a, they&#39;ve learned the lesson that they need to make sure that what they put there serves everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so are you a bit more, so there&#39;s three bullet points there. again, this is for people listening to it off the shelf, adapted from other sources. And custom, David is your plan to do a bit of two in the hope of getting to three. So you&#39;re adapting from other sources, but doing it in a custom way. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;ll be interesting to see what we build up if we actually end up with a design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause we&#39;re doing this series where we&#39;re looking at different bits of websites effectively, where, we started with the co word components, but it&#39;s bits and bobs of websites that we&#39;re talking about. next time we&#39;re talking, we&#39;re gonna be talking about the head as a component, something you don&#39;t see even on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I see it as a component because there are certain rules about how you might construct your head in your document. So I would, so I&#39;m going there. Whether that turns into a design system, it is already for me because of the fact that I&#39;m saying. Okay. I&#39;ve got little notes in my, 11th at the moment, but it could be equally in a WordPress version of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little notes in this section where I put my head code and where I put certain things. So there is a sort of design system building up. But yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anything to add there, Paul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:03] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, so off the shelf is probably, like David said, always a little bit tricky because off the shelf is normally a digital product type thing or something to that effect that is trying to help you get from A to B super quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has to promise certain things that make sense to the person who is trying to cut some corners to get somewhere quickly. So I think that&#39;s when, we&#39;ve all lived in the WordPress world for quite a while and we&#39;re aware of the amount of templates you can buy or get for free, for different page layouts, row layouts, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I, think that the most of the three of us. We have been exposed to all of those, bought a bunch of them, look, use the free ones. And then we still end up building websites with our own layouts. And we, it&#39;s, and we perhaps just look at those for design inspiration sometimes. I think, oh, that&#39;s quite a nice, but I&#39;m not gonna actually use that row because it&#39;s got this problem, or it&#39;s not really, it, looks completely different than the rest of my raise, but I&#39;ll take some ideas from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I think that&#39;s one of the problems with design systems, off the shelf is not all of them, but, they can suffer from having a, an agenda that is based around them getting sold as opposed to long term solving the problem. Nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s, they do some good, but I just think that&#39;s why so many of them just don&#39;t, don&#39;t succeed perhaps. I know when you look at a lot of the template packs within WordPress, they have to, their agenda has to be bling. They have to appeal to the person who can&#39;t design, let&#39;s say, who needs to look like they can. And we&#39;ll be like, oh, that looks cool. I&#39;ll just grab that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, and that&#39;s why you see some absolutely horrendous websites that look like, do you know those, that those kids toys where you ma match the different head body clothes and, you can put like the, put a skirt at the bottom and then a top hat at the top. So you get this kind of thing that the, somebody just doesn&#39;t realize is a complete Frankenstein website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so me, I&#39;m probably doing custom to, but I. Using, using a system that locks me into how I have to use it. But I&#39;m probably essentially trying to create my own ones that work for me. So I&#39;m, eating my own dog foods, I think is it or whatever, but creating systems that work for me and then distributing them to a few other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. but I&#39;m totally taking influence from other things that I see. for instance, within the WordPress space, I think one that does quite well is, I think there&#39;s a theme called Ollie. Is it Ollie? That&#39;s right. Ollie. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right. Yep. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:56] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; And they&#39;ve had to work very hard to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to reduce, I assume what they&#39;re trying to do is they&#39;ve got a product and the big challenge they&#39;ve got is that they, the system that their, website is built on is the Gutenberg block editor, which has tons of cognitive dissident for end users. So people go into it, hearing all the hype, and then they bounce off and then they go straight back to Elementor or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Alias had to work very Ollie. the theme alias had to work, and the team now have had to work very hard to try to onboard customers who then they hope will find this totally usable. Make sense? Because the UX is very good in the templates that they provide. The onboarding is very good, and so they&#39;re trying to create like a good experience to stop people from bouncing back to elemental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you look at their templates, you can see that they&#39;ve put a lot of thought into it to try and stop people from failing at the first hurdle, compared to templates that you&#39;ll see elsewhere. yeah. My, just for, information, what it is that, when you&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m creating things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a number of systems that I&#39;ve been creating. They definitely wouldn&#39;t tick all the boxes of the, hardcore elite, design system gurus. They&#39;ll be problematic in all sorts of ways, but there&#39;s probably three different levels of, that I&#39;ve been doing. The one that I&#39;m doing at the moment is for Beaver Builder, and it&#39;s because Beaver Builder has the ability to have global colors and variables and stuff like that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can now build a kind of wire frame type set that is built around purposes, like I said, on the government. Website. So the purpose of this route or this page is to achieve this and that, page will have patterns in it, and then it&#39;ll have patterns will have components in it that are all reusable and they are feeding their style from the style guide, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but mostly it&#39;s pattern libraries, I would say, and the component libraries are just natural to me to put into those. So that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s my favorite one because I really feel that&#39;ll be super useful to me, to use. So I know it&#39;ll be useful to other people. the other one is commercially out there not to buy, but it&#39;s with, it&#39;s for an agency who do a lot of websites within the kitchen and bathroom design industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created a design system, or you could call it a starter website. Essentially it could be called a design system. And that means that they internally no longer have to come to me every time they want to launch a website. I just deploy the system. And I&#39;ve trained people who are not web developers and designers to build websites, and they are building whenever they&#39;ve tried to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this, they were building, Frankenstein websites that they thought look fantastic and their clients love too because they were letting their clients tell them what to do and everyone was happy and they got paid, but the customers weren&#39;t buying for the kitchens. now they&#39;re making, websites that look really cool and have a following all of the templates and are based on all the things that we learned for the last four years, developing kitchen websites, kitchen design company websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they&#39;re able to deploy these websites in a couple of days. And now they&#39;re design systeming their content as well, if that&#39;s possible. so because they know now, okay, when we have a page that has a showroom is about the showroom, we have two things. We have a company that has one showroom or we have a client that has multiple showrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we deal with a company that has multiple showrooms. This is how we deal with a company that only has one showroom. So that will then mean that when they have multiple showrooms, there&#39;ll be a choice page, which showroom do you want to go to? And then that will lead to the page, which is the, this is a showroom page, which tends to be all about telling a story of how beautiful your experience is gonna be when you come in and have a coffee, rever us and sit down and have a look and try out the different appliances and blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that&#39;s the second one. And the third one is a template set that is based on a content. Copywriting, copywriting framework. I won&#39;t say which one it is &#39;cause I probably get in trouble. but it&#39;s loosely based on, a copywriting framework. that basically is another in ingredient to these design systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;ve got the end use, you, then you&#39;ve got, where does the words come from? And then you&#39;ve got the design aspects. So I&#39;ve mixed it up and I don&#39;t have one yet that is all three of these things, but that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to work to at some point. But I think that&#39;s why if you really want a good design system, perhaps you start off the shelf for your inspiration and then start creating your custom one that is adapted from the things that you&#39;re learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&#39;s the right way to do it. &#39;cause if it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s gonna be a total waste of time for everybody. There&#39;s a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; bit of all three there, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:42] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s really interesting what you&#39;re talking about. the thing you didn&#39;t mention is that StoryBrand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:49] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s the word I was trying not to mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause I think if you use StoryBrand, you were supposed to pay a license to StoryBrand. So I don&#39;t think it was that one David. Actually, I think it was something similar StoryBrand, but it was, I built a system that uses, an idea similar to StoryBrand in which is based loosely also on the, what is called the, pain agitation solution system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes. So define the pain that the customer is feeling why they would want their product. agitate that a little bit. What is the problem that will happen to them if they don&#39;t do something about this? This doesn&#39;t have to be a negative thing. It can be that you are missing out on the amazing thing that can be the agitation and then the solution as you present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the thing that you offer that takes, that turns &#39;em from the loser that they are, if they don&#39;t go with your product to the absolute hero that they will be if they buy it. And then you provide evidence of other people who were losers before they chose your amazing product and are now massive heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, I think some of the technical design systems, are design and code focused. And then when you hit the, when the rubber hits the road, you have end users and you have, how should we communicate to those end users? And that&#39;s why I think like a design system needs to be a bit looser and include end user goals, business goals, and a copywriting, direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. What are you, what&#39;s the, what&#39;s the consistent tone of voice that you can have throughout this? And we&#39;ve, StoryBrand, for instance, it&#39;s, always about making the end user feel like the hero. Yeah, so if, if you say, we&#39;re using StoryBrand, this design system, and here are our end user goals, then everyone can get on board who&#39;s involved, and you can even communicate it to a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found things like using StoryBrand or paying Agitation solutions super useful when I&#39;m going into a Zoom meeting with five different stakeholders from a company who&#39;ve all gonna have opinions, but I frame the whole meeting around, let&#39;s just do it like this. And then they all love it because they can all contribute to that and they can contribute to how we make the user feel like a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can all contribute to how we, I identify the pain that the user has got or the customer&#39;s got before they buy the product. And it really helps get people on board. And then when I show them a wire frame or a design using a secret design system that I&#39;ve got for them, they see what they said reflected in the design rather than.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, if five people are all disagreeing, when you show those five people the design, they&#39;re all gonna disagree on the design because they didn&#39;t see, each of them saw the thing that they disagreed about in there. I dunno where I was going with that, but, essentially it was the, I think you&#39;ve gotta have an inclusive design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise, you&#39;re not gonna get buy-in from the stakeholders that will need to sign off on it and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okie doke. I think that was a full investigation of that part, wasn&#39;t it? Should we, should we move on to the potential benefits? David, you ready for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Okay. I&#39;ve just, I&#39;ll just jump in. I just thought that was quite interesting &#39;cause that&#39;s not Yeah. Definitely what you are describing. There is something that I think you need, this system, but it&#39;s not included in what, what the articles I look at say what makes up a no design system and that, a kind of copywriting system goes in your design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all part and parcel of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:24] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of, one of the ones that are built is, yeah. Starts with that because a major problem for web designers and end user clients is tone of voice and how they communicate. So you could throw a load of call elements at a page that have got a fantastic design system in there, but, You might just be doing that based on that you thought it looked cool. so it, if you use a system like StoryBrand, it takes you, it tells you your top row should be, your top, line should be a, unique value proposition. your second line should outline in very brief bullet points, the key benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third line, the third row outlines the problem and possibly agitation in the same row. So you have this kind of, so I need to do a unique value proposition. What are my possible design patterns and components to do that? Yeah. And the obvious one is gonna be like a hero banner and then a design component of that is gonna be a heading, but it shouldn&#39;t just say the name of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the design system, in my opinion, should include a. the, big heading isn&#39;t just a H one HML tag that&#39;s big. It is that HML tag should have a point to it, which is to convince somebody if they only read that one heading on the entire website before they decided to bounce or click forward, that it also told them the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to me, like content and the end user goals is totally part of the design, but I don&#39;t see that included in a lot of the sort of more academic talking around design systems because it&#39;s, a design industry talking about it. So whereas, whereas I have to hit the, meet the rubber where it hits the road and deal with CEOs and opinionated marketing execs and cousins of the CEO or nephews and nieces and all that sort of stuff, and I have to try and keep them on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that I don&#39;t retire from the project with an excuse if something came up because I&#39;ve lost complete control. So I have to say, that&#39;s why I think, bringing some of those elements would be really useful to design. And I think gov the UK government does that to this extent. With, its, with, its the purpose of this one is this, they don&#39;t necessarily, they even give the content examples, because, especially for these more transactional sort of things that you should say this and these are the words that you can say, I think it&#39;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, I think that&#39;s a, fabulous site. And I think that the US have pretty much adopted this kind of thing. How, I my understanding is that the US kind of went more down the, whole react route and it lost money. I think there&#39;s a sort sense that when you are losing billions as they do, you, they&#39;ve had to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an agile way, and they have to work, to these kind of more fundamental systems that, start with a html first approach to everything, in terms of the technicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:36] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. I think this just highlights it. Just, stay on that reacting just for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:43] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; think, this is possibly what you think as well, but it&#39;s certainly what I think is that as soon as the, concept of web components became tied verbally to react or similar, so it is like, what JavaScript library do you use to create your web components?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out of the conversation at that point. I, they, I was lost to it because I&#39;m not really a JavaScript developer and, but I, but think how many other stakeholders downstream of. And not very good JavaScript developer are now completely out of the conversation of loss control. So it just made this, to me, this, and I think this is what W three C has identified, that, as soon as this kind of culture of JavaScript libraries got mixed up with design systems, it made, web dev high, highly skilled web developers, gatekeepers Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, decision making. Yeah. And it seems that was the wrong way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Going so high level really, that you lost it. And then, and I think now as we become more. conscious of accessibility and getting back to that web, that it should serve all people. That&#39;s its unique selling point above all of the mediums is the fact that anyone with a computer then can adapt it and get the same information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s truly inclusive and that got lost. When all your developers and all the people are thinking about JavaScript first they skip over to, then they find something to solve CSS maybe Tailwind that will plug in. That&#39;s a system that will work. And then, the last thing they&#39;re learning then is HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we learn more, HTML doesn&#39;t cover us full accessibility. We need to learn a little bit of Aria to get there. And and I think that&#39;s where I like those kind of, like you say with the UK ones, because they have to start from that basis of inclusivity. Yep. So it builds up on those foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:51:45] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their mix seems really, thought out. And, inclusion inclusionary, if that&#39;s a word. it is now. It is, yeah. It makes sense in my context. I think with the ARIA tags and the h, like you say, the H ml tags that get you to 80% and then the aria takes you over the line to truly define what this content is, as opposed to with the JavaScript route, which you sometimes can&#39;t even see the content behind the scenes, it&#39;s dynamically changing in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:25] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; and, it&#39;s, yeah. Yeah. Let&#39;s move on. Sorry. Okay. No, that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; fine. That&#39;s absolutely fine. a couple of sections we&#39;ve got left, so potential benefits and finally considerations. potential benefits have been listed out as follows. We&#39;ll just, I&#39;ll just read them out and then we can Yeah, you can explore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits are as follows, four things Dave has listed. Efficiency and cost saving, reducing tedious tasks, maintaining quality or reducing errors. And finally reducing staff dependency through documentation. I suppose they&#39;re all fairly self-explanatory, but do we wanna open those up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I think we&#39;ll go on to the considerations, which I think the next thing, there are benefits obviously, if you can have some sort of system that you, that&#39;s really what I feel like I&#39;m trying to work out is a way of avoiding errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get into looking at everything I put on a website, I&#39;m, I made the no script show one, and I&#39;m, but going back on it, re correcting things as I go through this series on components here. &#39;cause I realize, oh, I forgot about this. Oh, yeah. It&#39;s it&#39;s getting built. but yeah, so I think there&#39;s something to have some documentation even for yourself that reminds you of when you do certain things, even if it is, as I say, what we&#39;ll do next time ahead of which you don&#39;t even see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, one thing that did cross my mind, with style guides and branding, I said earlier and I think this is open for question now. a company might need a, some, something might stay there in terms of a style guide and it might be a permanent thing. But I question this these days because we are moving so rapidly towards this idea of users choosing their own journey on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;light and dark mode is the one that&#39;s taking off the most that you even that isn&#39;t so true these days if we&#39;re moving forward with this idea that there are different presentations for different types of users, depending on their own preference of how they want to consume the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:33] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; it sounded like led into the first two points actually quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. So let&#39;s go through those then. Yeah. So the considerations, first of all, long term efficiency in an ever changing industry. Second one where design consistently stifles creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, how do we build the right foundations again, because it&#39;s your, both of you have significantly more experience. It&#39;s over to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:59] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I say something about these? These actually, so David, your approach is. Much more resilient to point number one, long-term efficiency in an ever-changing industry where you are going as deep as the H TM L code and the aria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when this comes back to this whole lifespan of a design system, most of the systems I&#39;m using should all page builders suddenly disappear. At least I can take some of the thinking and then apply it to HTML and I&#39;ll be one step behind you on the tech, but I can probably get there, in time, given time sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this ever changing industry, it&#39;s not even really the, the industry is like us, we are the people who make this stuff right. But to me, I think the, like the word industry could be interchangeable with, the, I dunno what the word is actually, but, so for, instance, web, currently we use website in a browser and that&#39;s how we look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or on a phone. And then content now is, can be fed into things like apple, newsreader, those sort of things. So basically some of the websites I would make would not farewell in some of these situations where content needs to adapt to a different device or something that isn&#39;t a web browser. Everything I&#39;m doing is assumed that it is been consumed, probably on a web browser or a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browser. Okay. Yeah. whereas, I can totally see that, especially with ai. I know that this is controversial, topic as such, but if it gets to the point where you don&#39;t even really look at websites anymore. We spoke about this on the last one, I think, where you just say, Hey, where basically websites are made on the fly in some kind of, they&#39;re made in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you ask something about, Hey, can you tell me about what&#39;s the best fender guitar from the JA made in Japan in the eighties? Chat. GPT will currently give you a kind of chat about that at the moment, but it&#39;s not an inconceivable that at some point it will create a custom webpage for you that you just look at as if that page had been made with pictures and videos and all that sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would, you would imagine it would need to be able to query its sources and see h TM L tags, find aria, attributes and stuff like that. And it would only really pull in that content where it was confident that it was the correct content because it could see how it was marked up. It&#39;s not gonna go to, one of my websites where a client has told me to put this over here and make this thing flying over there and then this popup comes up or something because it&#39;s just too much chaos and noise for a future device to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think, The, gov website is perfect example again because you can see that those elements could transfer into other devices that we don&#39;t yet know that people want to use. So you could equally, they could plug an API into chat GBT for instance, and have you pay your, council tax straight fire, via chat EBT if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that&#39;s where we&#39;ll end up going. That different systems will just be plugging into things and APIs and, the current SME and charity and nonprofit sector is gonna struggle with that because we&#39;re all stuck in that sector, both the clients and the people serving it like me in this relatively short term view of everybody wants to go to your website and a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make a website for a web browser and when it becomes a problem, they&#39;ll ask me to make a system that works in chat GPT so they can, do you know what I mean? but we&#39;ll be playing catch up massively at that point. David, your approach of thinking about this HML structure. you might not have the content that chat, GPT or whatever system wants to pull in, but at least you&#39;ll have the structure correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it can understand and interpret and know, oh, basically here&#39;s some prices of those guitars that you want and it&#39;ll put it in a component pricing table and it&#39;ll know to recommend this guitar and it&#39;ll have a pricing table, right? That isn&#39;t even from a website. It&#39;s just gone does this Mexican guitar, USA Fender and then the Japanese one recommended with a little tag on it, most popular for people who are thinking like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is presented as a pricing table with benefits and stuff like that. so I think that&#39;s I think that we&#39;ll see the ever changing to me is that everything&#39;s gonna be much more dynamic and on the fly using components and patterns that are marked up. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:59:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we would probably, That&#39;s, I don&#39;t like the idea that, that search engines are now providing the ai, I feel they are. It&#39;s broken, the deal with people, because at the end of the day, it&#39;s making us dependent on our content, stolen our content. Basically, AI is stolen everybody&#39;s work. And it&#39;s remarketed to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll ever be able to. I think the more you get into, the skill of writing a website, I&#39;ve only become more appreciative of this recently, particularly as you get into the accessibility, because there isn&#39;t. machine isn&#39;t gonna quite do it because it has to make d you have to make decisions about how you will label your aria or where you will label it a, according to your imagined audience for the content and the different circumstances that they might be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to imagine that anything will automatically, do that. We&#39;ll be able to present random content and get that right, not if CloudFlare has got anything to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:00:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:00] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; because CloudFlare is, providing a system to block your website from AI bots. Yeah. Unless you pay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s like a paywall for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:01:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It&#39;s just hot off the press. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we, we can, if there is a set of rules, but I think this is always where we want to go with design systems and it&#39;s even with ai, it&#39;s my thought on things at the moment. It&#39;s a very materialistic view of the world where you think that everything can be explained if we get down to a certain set of materials that we understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously when we&#39;ve got Jeffrey Hinton, the sort of godfather of AI now panicking about, general intelligence, as a reality, I don&#39;t know if it ever will be. Obviously it poses a threat to us. Depending on how we use it. This is another conversation here. Yeah. This is complete, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ton of words, but it&#39;s in the same with the, design systems. I think, the idea that we&#39;re seeing certain things are making us feel like this is going to provide the solution. Like we&#39;re not far away from Google. That it can now grab the information and it&#39;s really useful in that, and now it&#39;ll be able to present it in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&#39;t believe that&#39;s ever going to be the case,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:02:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in, the same way that in physics there&#39;s always this, there&#39;s always this rush to, there&#39;s always this idea that you&#39;ll get this grand unified theory. It feels a bit like that&#39;s what we&#39;re describing here, this grand unified theory of what the internet is and what design is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe it&#39;ll never. being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:02:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; achieved. it&#39;s always a problem. And, for people like Jeffrey Hinton or Materialists who explain things, so they say, I can explain everything in science and this is how it works. And then you go, yeah, but okay, so I explain the body and you go, yeah, but why do I think, why am I conscious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they go, that&#39;s just, phenomenal. Don&#39;t worry about that. Forget that worry. We&#39;ve solved it. The whole thing about having a conscious conscience is, or consciousness is, irrelevant to this conversation. And I think sometimes that&#39;s how you get, when you look at things scientifically, when you comes to the art of communication via the web, we start to think, it will serve the stuff, but will it really communicate with real human conscious beings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I never quite convinced, I always think that it&#39;s just a bunch of scientists thinking they&#39;re going to nail this. There&#39;s, a formula here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; We will, we&#39;ll probably revisit this topic in two years time when our robot overlords have taken over. Yes. And, we will just be simulations because we&#39;ve been scraped on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you think we&#39;ve achieved what we set out to achieve? Are we at the end of that episode, do you imagine? Or is there more to say? I think we&#39;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:44] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; still confused as, as ever. Yeah. But, that&#39;s never, but we,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s never gonna change. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:03:52] &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lacey:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s &#39;cause we&#39;re normal, people. But, the, that consistency stifles creativity on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. that&#39;s an interesting one to me. &#39;cause I don&#39;t think consistency ever does stifle creativity. I think, I think, just, mashing things up and throwing them all over a page isn&#39;t creativity. It&#39;s just, I. It just, it gives, it&#39;s like a, gaslighting version of creativity that some that, an end user doesn&#39;t appreciate, but the owner of the website appreciates more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s, web design, consistency stage creativity. I don&#39;t think it starts create creativity. I think design consistency helps to get rid of, vanity aspects nicely. You can still be totally cre creative. You shouldn&#39;t just be, you shouldn&#39;t fail to be creative if you&#39;ve got consistency. so I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:04:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds like a great meme. Yeah. There you go. We&#39;ll probably parcel that off as the, as the, little, the bit that this episode goes out under. I will try to, I&#39;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:05:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; try to make that happen. No, I think that&#39;s what you do quite well on it because of the fact that you&#39;ve do got a design system where you&#39;ve got row and they&#39;re spaced out in a logical way because you are using a lot of your own CSS to make sure that s space is consistent through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And for users, there is a, certainly if you understand the, how people perceive space and what they mean to them, this, it drives us mad and we can tell a bad design because they&#39;ve used the page builder and just drop something in and it&#39;s, half a centimeter off or something, how it was on the other page and it&#39;s jarring and we know this, and that kind of consistency helps us with our perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think sometimes that consistency in a different way, a consistency of doing things in a certain way, then leads to. as we can see with design, they, we might have thought we&#39;ve got the perfect design in 2000 or something, and none of them look like that any longer. unless we&#39;re doing it for comedic effect, So we constantly change. So I think that&#39;s the problem with the design system. You build a whole load of layouts that you&#39;re going to use, and you just think these were just web layouts, then they don&#39;t, some, that&#39;s more interesting thing that you&#39;ll see in print and in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[01:06:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am gonna knock it on the head in that case. At that point. so that was episode number 22, or at least you can find it at no script show slash 22. You can head to the URL there and hopefully you will be able to find the relevant show notes there. it only remains for me to, to say thank you to, to Paul for joining us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, thanks Paul. I appreciate your, your contributions to the debate today. That&#39;s great. So we&#39;ll see you on the next one. Thanks guys. Yeah, you&#39;re very welcome. See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Here &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; tags are changed to &amp;lt;button&amp;gt; tags when JS loads. The hamburger works as a modal dialog which traps the user within it by default. The last option escape the modal via the last focusable item. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; &lt;strong&gt;David&#39;s note:&lt;/strong&gt; some years ago I used &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://affinitycentre.co.uk/&quot;&gt;imitate a mega-menu &lt;/a&gt;. Until a month ago, I&#39;ve not seen anyone using this for navigation menus. It seems to work with only a few lines of JS, but I have not tested it emough to cover here. Improvement is needed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simpler-navigation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/simple-navigation/&quot;&gt;Simpler Navigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with HTML and CSS there are few things than can be done to make the experience better for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This video is a follow up to our podcast episode on website navigation. You can find that at no script show slash 21. The numbers two and one here. We&#39;re looking at some examples and their code. And the links for these can be found at no script show slash learn, forward slash 13. And again, the numbers one three joined as always by David Waumlsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. Oh so this one, we&#39;re concentrating on the accessibility on the audio. We were talking about everything really to do with navigation and we concluded that being the no script show. We try and avoid hide and show with JavaScript as much as possible. But I thought for this, I should at least show some examples of accessible ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course these are by other people because I. I can&#39;t write JavaScript, okay. I&#39;ll just go through a few examples. So the first one, which we mentioned in the audio, was from the web accessibility initiative. They&#39;ve got some great examples if anyone does need what they call flyout menus with the JavaScript that you can use for these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are, as you say, there&#39;s all these different variations, like somewhere you can get to the sub menu via the, little icon on the side. And as you can see on this, it works if you hover to open up the side menu. So it&#39;s a link as well as a sort of hover state on the, yeah. Little icon. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the, they&#39;ve got that. when you, if you are a tabbing along, then you&#39;ll tab to each and then tab to that one, it&#39;ll drop it. So screen readers and, people using keyboards will, treat this differently. So this is a really useful resource, but what I will say about this is I probably wouldn&#39;t use it because I think I&#39;m quite a fan of the idea of progressive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you disabled JavaScript or it doesn&#39;t load for people, none of these work. So it&#39;s accessible. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; basically all of those, yeah, they&#39;ve gone from the world if you don&#39;t have JavaScript. yep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. So they&#39;re worth checking out as, examples if that&#39;s what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s the downside as, as far as I &#39;cause it. Also, the other downside of it is that there isn&#39;t an example if you just want a copy and paste of CSS that makes this good for mobile. So it will just squeeze, I won&#39;t, squeeze it in, but as you can imagine, when they squeeze in, so space and bear will just get squashed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So it&#39;s just using flexbox. So there isn&#39;t really a, an attractive design element to that. A useful resource. The other thing, and he&#39;s brilliant, I&#39;ve mentioned it before on the show, Manuel, Matovich, he just easy for you to say it&#39;s not, and I&#39;m sure I said it wrong, but he&#39;s wonderful. And the way he presents stuff, he&#39;s done some great CSS day talks and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s got a book called Accessibility Cookbook, which is really easy to consume. You can just take different bits out of it on this one. but in a way he is, and I&#39;ll go to his examples. Now, you can actually steal these examples without getting the book I&#39;ve been reading through the book, which is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his examples, let me just see if I can find them here, are all available on his, accessibility cookbook.com site where the code is. And he is got a few examples he builds up on it. So there&#39;s this one where you&#39;ve got all the code that you need, including the JavaScript and CSS for an example, which you can find on Code Pen, which I&#39;ll show you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this looks a bit ugly, you would need to do more with it. But basically when you are there, we are, we&#39;ve got normal menu and when we yep, click on there, we get ju with CSS, we&#39;ve got an icon, hamburger icon, and then a menu here. And pretty straightforward JavaScript. And of course this is much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a little bit janky the animation on this. But it works. Again, it&#39;s the progressive enhancement on this side. That means that I probably wouldn&#39;t use it. I know he is a big fan of progressive enhancement, but again, it&#39;s accessible. But if you are worried about JavaScript not loading or loading slowly, then, that&#39;s maybe not the option to go with for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s that one. Now, okay, now we move into Sarah Sewer. Dan&#39;s, if I&#39;m saying her name right as well, I dunno, a practical accessibility course. she&#39;s brilliant and she is so meticulous over everything. So of course hers have been progressively enhanced and she goes through the whole process of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can just show you a few examples of her. So we, she starts off where we look at a, there&#39;s a. That&#39;s her course. she is brilliant. She&#39;s a bit of a, party pooper for those people who just love to do everything with CSS &#39;cause she points out how things might not be accessible if you don&#39;t add in JavaScript under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So there&#39;s this first, it&#39;s clickable, not hover. &#39;cause she&#39;s not a fan of that. And it&#39;s a fairly, I&#39;m not gonna go into the details here, but the, JavaScript gets a little bit more because she&#39;s progressively enhanced it. So if I were to, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll do it anyway. I, if this will work well because I know that CodePen, we can&#39;t see whatever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with that browser extension, but I&#39;m guessing you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; are disabling JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. You can&#39;t see that you are. I am doing that Uhhuh. And if I just refresh on this, yeah, code pen requires JavaScript, but I think it work anyway. Ah, yes it does. So we can&#39;t see our code now, but what we can see is. The state. Oh, yeah. When JavaScript fails. Yeah. So yeah, so what she does is that she builds progressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as she will, instead of using the button as the dropdown for something, she will use a span and then use the JavaScript to add in and change that role to a button. interesting. Yeah. Okay. But of course it makes, and I&#39;m now, which you can&#39;t see, I&#39;m now going to turn off my, disabling of JavaScript on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s a better solution. But then of course everything gets a little bit more complex with this. And let me move on to a next example where she, has the normal menu over here. Yeah. And then a drop down on the navigation for when we get to mobile sizes. Gosh, that&#39;s really neat. It is really neat. but again, even when you are as meticulous as she is about getting absolutely everything right and progressively hands it, there are still some like decisions you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she, she&#39;s done two here, she&#39;s done this, what is called as a design pattern. The draw, where the, overlay comes over the top and she&#39;s using changing things to dialogue role. And when you do that, you are trapped. So she calls this trapped and I&#39;m, if I could just show it on there. If I just move around here, you are trapped in that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; dialogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you, you have to, what? You have to click engage, there&#39;s no sort of escape functionality in the menu. That&#39;s, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you need to have a close here to be able to close this. so there is another alternative that she&#39;s made on this one. We&#39;re not trapped where if I just go into this again, we are using, it goes into the role of dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens on this one is you get to the last focusable item. It will take you out automatically. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a bit of swings and roundabouts there. I can see why that&#39;s good, but also why that&#39;s bad. Yeah. So you have to engage it every time you go through it. So if you miss a link, you&#39;ve gotta start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yeah. and I think this is the thing, what she will say on that, it will depend on your pattern and your research on this and, but it just shows you different, as we were talking about on the first thing, when you start to get into this, you can never quite get it right for everybody, can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Because somebody&#39;s gonna be expecting one set of behavior and they won&#39;t know as they go to different sites, which is made me, obviously her course is absolutely brilliant. She&#39;s really meticulous. But here&#39;s the thing. I am not, I. I&#39;m quite happy to do a little bit of JavaScript if I understand it, but I&#39;m not going through, this, rigmarole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Look at all that. That&#39;s a lot. That is a lot. Yeah. Yeah. To change. So I&#39;ll avoid it. But these are great examples. And maybe I&#39;ll use &#39;em one day on this. I will, just because of the fact that she puts things into a dialogue role, I will show something, which is, might shame me later, but I did experiment some years back with my own sort of way of imitating, mega menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;ll just, okay. I dunno if I didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think I clicked this right. No, you didn&#39;t. I just added it at the end &#39;cause I had it. &#39;cause I, maybe I&#39;ll get into this at some point, but what I&#39;ve done here is just on a regular menu, but I&#39;ve created this mega menu. Yeah. With the dialogue. You can have show modal, which is what it&#39;s designed for, and you can have just show where it will stick to the element that&#39;s near there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually you can still move around, things here, so it actually works. Now, I don&#39;t know, this is something where you might want to get a friend of yours, Joe Dawson, to look at and say, how terrible is this? I, know I need to fix some things, but it does actually work. it is enclosed because it&#39;s dialogue, but I&#39;ve gotta close so I can close it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. may, maybe we need to get Joe on this show and he can we can line up all of the previous websites that you&#39;ve ever made and be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know there were things wrong with this, but it&#39;s an interesting thing because I have not, I did this a couple of years ago because I was excited by the fact that we now had, dialogue, which we could use a little bit, how we&#39;re excited about details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I thought, can I use &#39;em for a menu? I dunno, I could not find a single person until last month. I have not seen a single person use it for a menu. And then you found one Rejoice. Yes. I, found some one, but they made the, actually I could show you on this. I won&#39;t show you on, I will actually, let me just do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to disable the JavaScript. &#39;cause what they didn&#39;t do, which at least I did do on this, is if I disabled the JavaScript, I put in a link now which goes to a site map. So you actually get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, even, okay. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That site is beautiful, by the way. It is a menu, isn&#39;t it? It is a kind of mega menu right there, the way you&#39;ve laid it out with columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You might not wanna get stuck down. No, there&#39;s a lot there. Something post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh. Yeah. So it might need improving for accessibility if your JavaScript breaks. So honestly, I don&#39;t know, it was just a little idea that I had that I wasn&#39;t gonna show, but I might work on it and see if there&#39;s something that can be done with it as a, if you do feel that you ever need it, if this can be, because it&#39;s so easy to do, it&#39;s just a few lines of JavaScript to get things to open because you&#39;re relying on hasty ml to do most of the work you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s really interesting. I like that. That&#39;s pretty neat. Yeah. And the CSS is easy &#39;cause you can just put it in a grid and it automatically moves. Yeah. yeah, I was quite pleased with it, but very nervous to show it to anyone because I just, there it is and it&#39;s gone. Yeah. But very easy if you put them in a grid to make it mobile responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it really, simple as I like it. Okay. So talk as simple. Should we go on to just talk about what we&#39;ve used on this site and what I&#39;ll be trying to get away with? So I&#39;ve, can I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just say, just for the sake of clarity, what you have used, this is not me. This is you. You&#39;ve done all this hard work, so don&#39;t give me the credit for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, you can avoid the shame as well that goes, I dunno about that. Yeah. okay. So there are some things, even when we&#39;re keeping it simple with h ml, CSS and Aria, there are some things that we probably need to, so I&#39;ve used on the intrinsic. Frameworks are the links there on my show notes there, and I&#39;ll put our own site in here just so I can show stuff on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is pretty straightforward on this, so I&#39;m just using Flex as most people do, because it, it sizes according to, the item, the menu item. all pretty similar here, but obviously Grid does it the other ways, puts boxes around it. So this is a pretty simple thing. I won&#39;t, I haven&#39;t put all the CSS code that&#39;s going into there, but obviously at a break point it just goes down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&#39;re sticking to something like five here, this will go down to, before it breaks and wraps again, it will go down to a screen of, I think 3, 7, 5 pixels, maybe three 50 or pretty small, so most, yeah. Yeah. So most mobiles are gonna get this. So without having to bring in a hamburger. We&#39;ve got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we showed before, what we have on this is on the mo. it takes you to where we&#39;ve got more straight to the navigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And with some&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; animation that goes on that. So that&#39;s it. And here&#39;s a couple of things that probably you&#39;ll get different information on if you are into accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve put the HTML code up here. Now once we put nav, once we use the nav, which we should to put our ur and, that&#39;s an important thing as well. If you&#39;re showing and hiding, never hide the whole nav else, otherwise it disappears from the table of contents. So that&#39;s really, so that&#39;s another thing you could make a mistake with, but we&#39;re not doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even even though we&#39;ve got nav, we might have more than one nav on a site. So we can use Aria label to say main. So it&#39;s, no, it&#39;s the main navigation. Got it. And I don&#39;t, I haven&#39;t written navigation because screen readers will announce that it&#39;s navigation. They&#39;ll know navigation main. So I put an Aria label of Main on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another thing to make things better all the time is to use Aria current for the users who, are without visual clues on what to look. So when you&#39;re on that particular page on, that AAG that you are using there, you&#39;ll put r current equals page. Yeah. for home on that one. That&#39;s a kind of good thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what I&#39;ve done here as I&#39;m showing you on our example, is. The names are different on here, but the link to the footer, another key thing to do is if you are an icon, which I&#39;m just using in the HCML, unit over here, put that to Hidden True, if you want that as an indicator, because you don&#39;t want that to be read out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen reader would read that out as down, downward triangle. Yeah. most of them would anyway, and then put an Aria label, which explains to them, because it&#39;s not so obvious visually for them to see. I&#39;ve put an Aria label in there saying that we&#39;re navigating two links in the foot. Links in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And, likewise, when you are meeting at that other end, there&#39;s actually, you&#39;re not far away from the get back to the top as well. So hopefully it&#39;s good. I&#39;ve made some quick marks that, NAV is a landmark so you can. that&#39;s a way of being able to tell screen readers the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s eight of &#39;em that are commonly known, like a banner, which tells &#39;em it&#39;s a header, a nav within that tells &#39;em what the navs are so they can move around from it. But the interesting thing is, and this is why I&#39;ve got, I&#39;ll, just skip ahead here. Option two is because some people will say, yes, NAV is accessible because it gives them this landmark so they know where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because they&#39;re not often well laid out on most pages, people still use the majority. I think it&#39;s closer to 70% of screen reader users will go to headers. Headings rather. Headings. Yeah. Yes. And so another way of doing it is to, in your nav you put, are we labeled by? Give that an ID and then connect that up to a visually hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;title which same main navigation on there. So some people sort That makes sense. Yeah. Will do that. Now the experts that I&#39;ve been following haven&#39;t been doing that with their head or text. They&#39;ve been using what I&#39;ve used in the first one, which is just used the RRE label. Now mostly they will say, this is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we? A label buy is better because of translation issues because of the way that screen readers will find things. Aria label is your last resort. If the HTML can say it, that&#39;s best if, are we a label buy is your next go-to. And then are we a label last? And the reason why I&#39;ve gone to Aria label and why I think they have too is because on the main menu you&#39;re probably likely to know in the head of that is the main navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also then you fall foul of the Of the has ml, which is usually in your main, should come first. You put a header before your header one if you like. It&#39;s fascinating,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; like these overlapping and con and slightly conflicting ways of achieving. Yes. It, and it sounds like there&#39;s no perfect way to, to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just, slightly better given the proclivities of the website you&#39;re working on. Yeah. That is really interesting. I, did not know what you&#39;ve just explained. Gosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. No, I didn&#39;t. And I, I got different experts and they told me, oh, you should do this. And then I thought, hang on, I&#39;ve got a head of two now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above my head are one, what&#39;s going on? And, Generally, I don&#39;t think it matters, it doesn&#39;t spoil your dumb order in any way. It&#39;s only, that kind of role. It&#39;s probably not the biggest thing. But of course if you are, checking some of these things, if you are using checkers, it&#39;s really annoying to have this flagged up that you&#39;ve got your yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headers in the wrong order, even though it&#39;s visually hidden. sorry, so I went off a little bit on this one. One thing to just mention as well, because if you are not up to date, which I wasn&#39;t, you&#39;ll hear some people say that you need to put the role of list in a nav for Safari users because Safari decided not to feature nut bug, but they thought that lists were overused in design, so they decided not to announce &#39;em to screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are. So they discount your role of lists. So an order ordered or ordered list. So discounted them. They&#39;ve changed this only quite recently. So if it&#39;s a list within a nav, they will read out how many items are in that. Okay. Alright. Yeah. So we don&#39;t need to do that, but you might see it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made a point about that. what else? Oh, there was a slight subnote on this and I dunno, I&#39;ve gone my own route with this one. I dunno how people, I, see people done this differently, but you get an issue like this on this page and it&#39;s not so much on this one, but I want this to have some CSS that tells me that this is the current section that I&#39;m in, in my main menu, but I&#39;m actually in an article within the component section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want a breadcrumb soft style thing, don&#39;t you? But not probably. Yeah. But I thought there&#39;s not many levels here. So what, I&#39;ve done, and I, won&#39;t open up the inspector, but basically what I&#39;ve done where we&#39;ve got that, I put Aria, oh, current, not page, but true to say that&#39;s where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an Aria label saying, currently viewing a single post on the components. And that&#39;s the same on the no script show as well. So if you go into our chats and you go into an individual chat, it will tell you that it&#39;s a, post on the chats. So that was my. Work around. I&#39;m just throwing it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No one&#39;s given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you, sorry to get into the technical weeds of this 11 t, the, CMS management tool that enables you to do that, does it, it can figure out that this is a page under the, tree if you like, the parent of components and then it will build that area label for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I had to put that sort of as a bit of programming in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. To make sure that it did it when it knows which one it&#39;s on. So Yeah. Interesting. New&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; idea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; though. I like it. That&#39;s going the extra mile. It feels. Yeah. I did have a look at, Andy Bell&#39;s site and I noticed when had a sort of similar situation. He just, it was still the CSS styling was active there, but it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just thought this was a bit of extra information. Yeah. Maybe, I&#39;ve made it more busy for screen readers. I don&#39;t know, but Rather than have breadcrumbs where, they&#39;re only going one level deep. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that helpful, Okay. Okay. Yeah, it&#39;s just my, yeah, I know you get into a lot on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;s not. Did I miss anything on there? I don&#39;t think I did. I didn&#39;t cover the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; CSS yet. Yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, there&#39;s not much to say. I can&#39;t cover it &#39;cause it&#39;s in the context of the header, but we&#39;re using Flex with Flex To make then that pretty good for headers in most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just put in some code here, which is showing how I&#39;m styling the underline when we&#39;re under that section so it&#39;s visually underlined when we&#39;re under this. Yep. So you know where you are. And then that&#39;s done with the CSS that&#39;s over here by picking out the HF and then putting, and I&#39;ve put it for now, I&#39;ve had to do it for True as well as page, Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it&#39;s now the a HF Aria current page and True as well. And then we&#39;ve used these new properties in CSS where we can actually decide the thickness of these ones and offset the underlining as well. To be honest, I might change this. this is a bit off what we were talking about because there&#39;s a really cool with view transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a border and you use view transitions, it creates that lovely effect where it feels like the border is moving along to your next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Almost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; like a Yeah, I know. I know what you mean. Like a little animation of something sliding to the next one kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; do it on this, so I might change this to a border anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get really in the weeds. Yeah. But it&#39;s a cool thing &#39;cause it used to take so much Yeah. Programming to create this sort of feeling like things anyway. Yeah. Styling a second target. Where have I put this down on there? Oh, that was just, this is just the script I&#39;ve put in because as when we hover down to, in that thing where we hovered and I highlighted, yeah, you click on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; link and it creates the border around it to Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it some focused. So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; just put, I put the styling in there that was used on that one. So we&#39;re using target. So it, that border is only showing to highlight. on the mobile it&#39;s fine because you&#39;re down to one column and everybody knows where you&#39;ve navigated to if you are going to the footer and you&#39;ve got other things in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just a way of highlighting with a bit of animation. But of course with animation, I&#39;ve also wrapped it around, no preference here, prefers reduced the amount reduced. Yeah. So if you&#39;ve, if you don&#39;t like motion, it disappears. And that&#39;s really it. I, apart from the fact that, did I put where I got it from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. There&#39;s a really great tool for animation, which is animus.net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; anim, A-N-I-M-I-S-T a.net. Anim net. I Be sure you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; just, get your CSS that you want from that. what else did I want to mention there? There just notes. flex, I&#39;ve already said that contains the unit, current page we&#39;re hiding globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, a good point actually. Something I failed to on the site I just showed you is that generally globally you might want to add to your A tags and increase, amount of padding by default because of such thing as target size, which is defined for accessibility. So you can hit the thing properly. Yep, When you&#39;re on touch mobiles where it&#39;s supposed to be, I dunno why in pixels, but 24 pixels, you&#39;re supposed to have around your, click the bullying, otherwise it starts to fail and, accessible. Yeah. You have to be very precise and have a perfectly pointy finger. Yes. Yeah. But yeah, if you haven&#39;t got that thing and silks two tied pixels that up for me, although I didn&#39;t spot it on my other site where I know I didn&#39;t have enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not always accurate, but I think that&#39;s it. Have I covered enough Cody stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Gosh, yeah, I think so. just to say that, obviously we&#39;re showing this on the screen, but it is available to you. no script show slash learn. Slash 13, the numerals one, three, no script show slash learn slash 13. Yeah, I think that&#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously we had a companion, podcast episode, which you can find at no script show slash 21, which obviously explains all of the bits and pieces that we&#39;ve been going through and why David, felt these bits of navigation were important to mention. I think that&#39;s it. Have we, captured what you wanted to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we have. Yeah. That was great. I enjoyed that. Yeah. In which case, I will see you next time. Thank you. So that was all about website navigation. Hope that you enjoyed it and we&#39;ll see you next time. Take it easy. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Website Navigation: Why is it so bloody awful?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/21/" />
    <updated>2025-06-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/21/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-website-navigation&quot;&gt;What is website navigation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list to help users find associated pages and documents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A table of content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ever-present menu bar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminology is difficult.  What some call navigation and links, others call menus and buttons. A menu to a developer has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/menu_role&quot;&gt;specific role&lt;/a&gt;. To an UX expert it may define a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-elements-glossary/#Menu-Bar&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-navigation&quot;&gt;Types of navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main link navigation (or menu bar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation activated by a &amp;quot;hamburger&amp;quot; icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadcrumbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Dropdowns&amp;quot; on click and hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links with adjacent icons concealing dropdown sub-menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested or multi-level &amp;quot;dropdowns&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega-menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s further terminology issues here. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/&quot;&gt;Heydon Pickering&lt;/a&gt; points out &#39;dropdown&amp;quot; is behaviour we get with the HTML &amp;lt;select&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;options&amp;gt;. Some refer instead to &amp;quot;pulldowns&amp;quot;.  The W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative refers to them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#flyoutnavmousefixed&quot;&gt;fly-outs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-needed-for-website-navigation&quot;&gt;Code needed for website navigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML gives us a semantic and accessible name with the &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt; element. Add in some &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags to an ordered or unordered list and we are good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add ARIA and we have an accessible way to add more navigation components on a page and tell screen readers their current page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add CSS and we can have beautiful horizontal nav bars where we can also visually indicate the current page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add JS and we can create interactive show and hide (disclosure widgets) along with many new ways to fail.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* We can hide and show with CSS, but hover menus are no use to keyboard users and difficult on touch devices.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigation-problems&quot;&gt;Navigation problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux&quot;&gt;UX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu bars often look similar, but behave differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can’t click on things we do not see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy dropdown solutions make sloppy site architecture easy too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should indicate links that go to pdfs or external sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown on hover can interrupt a user’s journey to another target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide and show options should not obscure important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disclosure widgets have an interaction cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are dropdowns becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongdesign.co/articles/tired-trend-drop-down-navigation-menus&quot;&gt;tired design pattern&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega-menus improve UX and we have seen some head turning examples such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/gb&quot;&gt;stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, but is it best way? It depends on JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API&quot;&gt;view transitions&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading&quot;&gt;speculative loading&lt;/a&gt; could move us from imitating desktop apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &amp;quot;menu&amp;quot; has a few items to avoid hamburger* clicks, but links to a second nav in the footer.The target is styles and animated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/&quot;&gt;NNG&lt;/a&gt; updated their view on hamburger menus. They found it now to be commonly reconisable if placed top left and contains 3 bars. &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;seo&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS may create search issues or be viewed as secondary content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden content could lead to less pages visited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straightforward until we try to hide and show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most checkers can&#39;t pick up on nav failures that most sites have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt; can give us accessible dropdowns, but how screen readers announce them is not aways suitable and in-page search makes them stay open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the role of menu for website navigation means we have to add support for  &lt;kbd&gt;space&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;arrow →&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;Esc&lt;/kbd&gt; keys too. Generally best avoided, but there is this &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessible-mega-menu.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this was informed by Manuel Matuzović&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility-cookbook.com/&quot;&gt;Web Accessibility Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;, the Web Accessibility Initiative work and Sara Soueidan’s  &lt;a href=&quot;https://practical-accessibility.today/&quot;&gt;Practical Accessibility course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not suprisingly, the conclusion is that the No Script Show should, where possible, avoid scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This is the second in our series looking at various components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re talking about website navigation and why it&#39;s so bloody awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format for this series is that we&#39;ll first chat about the components and consider them from a UX design, accessibility, technical, and SEO perspective. Then we&#39;ll follow this audio focused episode with a short YouTube video looking at code snippets and working examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the links for those, this show can be found at no script show slash 21. That&#39;s the numerals two one, no script show slash 21. And if you want some code examples, then head to no script Show forward slash learn. Forward slash 13. So the numbers one, three. No script show slash learn forward slash 13. As always, the person that&#39;s doing the actual hard work on this podcast is David Waumsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just turn up and talk. Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:05] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. this is really interesting &#39;cause I thought, oh, I can&#39;t do menus yet. There&#39;s so much with it and there is &#39;cause we&#39;ve got a lot to get through. But it&#39;s been so fascinating because when I started trying to put some code snippets together for kind of components earlier on, I thought, oh I need this mega manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need these dropdown setups. I&#39;ve got a whole bunch of things I need. And doing this and doing a bit of research, particularly with the accessibility, I&#39;ve just ended up. Going with another instinct of mine is that we really make kind of website navigation overly complex sometimes, which is not always great for users and really hard technically to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. You&#39;ve, you&#39;ve put together a, on the webpage that I just mentioned, you&#39;ve put together a really exhaustive list of all of the bits and pieces that go into a navigation menu. Far more in all honesty than I&#39;d ever thought about. I honestly, my position prior to reading your document was just put the headline things in and then create a site map and hope that Google will surface the content and kind of forget about it there, but there&#39;s a lot more to it and it&#39;s really fascinating what you&#39;ve thrown together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I show the yeah. The, notes. Yeah. Show the, page. Okay. So here we are. So you&#39;ll be able to find this at no script show slash 21, if you want to. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; let&#39;s get into it. Yeah, the f following the format we started with last time, we, try and define what we&#39;re talking about with website navigation, and there really isn&#39;t a definition here with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could say, I&#39;ve, listed a list that helps users to find associated pages and documents because it&#39;s not always internal links. It can be external links or it can be other documents like PDFs or even some decide to attach Word documents, even menus. is it a table of contents? effectively a table of contents on a website does the same thing, but we have a perhaps, generally a different view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it an ever present menu bar? And often people call it menu. And that&#39;s, honestly, there&#39;s no real definition out there because the terminology is so difficult. I think when we start talking about website navigation, so what some people will call. Navigation links, which is what I would generally call it these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people will call menus and buttons, and I dunno about you, with clients sometimes you get this sort of mismatch of what you&#39;re talking about. They&#39;re saying the bot, the button&#39;s on the top, I need them to be, and you&#39;re thinking, oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there is no button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, I know exactly what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like obviously to you and I, we&#39;ve probably settled upon a term that you, like I use menu interchangeably with nav. Yes. I shorten navigation always to nav and and when I speak to clients very often the case was that yeah, they would just use a different. A different term, like a link or a button or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so those words are not out in the mainstream, so it&#39;s very difficult to define. But, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and I made a note here because I didn&#39;t appreciate this until I started doing this research on it. It&#39;s the fact that if you&#39;re a developer, the menu is actually a specific technical term, which means that if you use, if you mark up your, nav with menu as give it a roll of menu, then there are a whole bunch of expected behaviors that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like you should be able to use a space bar, the escapes key, the arrow keys and all of that. So it&#39;s actually technically a menu from a developer&#39;s point of view, or the role of menu is for those desktop applications and the, in fact, screen readers switch to a different mode. So you, if you decide to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use menu as a sort of technical role for your menu. You&#39;ve got a whole bunch of responsibilities that go with that. &#39;cause the screen reader has a certain expectation. So fascinating. But then if you go and look at something like the Nielsen Norman Group, I think I&#39;ve got it right way this time. Norman Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&#39;ll go with that. Yeah, so they will use. They&#39;re talking about patterns, usability, and how things will function for those. So they use the term menu bar for this constantly visible, section that&#39;s on, on your top of your page that navigates people and the navigation is things that might come off that, So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I just read the sentence that&#39;s written on the page in front of you there? Yeah. Just to show how interchangeable and weird the terms are, a type of navigate. So it&#39;s under the subheading of N navigation bar. It says a type of navigation menu implemented as a menu bar, hosting navigation categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they&#39;ve they&#39;ve used navigation twice. They&#39;ve used menu twice. And it is very hard to understand. In my head, I&#39;ve just decided, and this could be completely wrong, that menu is a, noun, and navigation is a verb. So the menu is the object, and navigation is the thing. The thing that you are doing, you are navigating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via the menu. That&#39;s where I&#39;ve landed. I dunno if that&#39;s gonna work or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; The, probably with NAV as well, of course. It&#39;s a, sort of technical role. It&#39;s a landmark in accessibility, so it stands for something itself. So it&#39;s not so much a verb in that sense. anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but yeah. But, if you think about it, if you go to a restaurant, you are never gonna say, can I have the navigation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are gonna say, can I have the menu? Which if you like, then is a series of links, for want of a better word, things that you can get to, in other words, a plate of food arrives at your, table. but you. Navigation is what you do when you receive the menu. You navigate around and your finger decides, oh, I&#39;m gonna go look at this one for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I like the look at this. and so the navigation is the, doing the menu is the thing that you, hold. And like I said, I don&#39;t know that&#39;s gonna hold water. There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanna go off onto a tangent. There&#39;s a, yeah, sorry. Absolute. No, But with menus, there&#39;s a thing that&#39;s annoying me about menus when you go into restaurants right now, I dunno if this is happening in the uk, it&#39;s happening in India quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go in and you ask for the menu and they don&#39;t give you that. You have to get your smartphone out. Oh yeah. And you have to, and then you have to navigate through. Yeah. So yeah. Anyway, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Honestly, I could go on &#39;cause the whole 10 minutes would disappear. okay. So where are we at there? So you&#39;ve done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. and you, there&#39;s just a little paragraph, which I don&#39;t know, got explored. A menu to a developer has a specific role. Yeah. To a UX person. It may define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Pattern. Pattern. Yeah. So it&#39;s just what I was talking about then and I was just putting them up for those who can see where they are. Define there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Anyway, so we can use these words interchangeably. There&#39;s a lot of those that come up. Should we talk about the types of navigation we&#39;ve got? And this is why I think they&#39;re so bloody awful and confusing. I think we&#39;ve known this forever. I think the Norman Ling group way back probably in the two thousands talked about how dropdowns were terrible usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we have the main link navigation or menu bars. We know it. These kind of things that we expect to see often on the top right of a desktop application where we&#39;ll see home about contact services, et cetera. That main navigation. Then we have navigation now that&#39;s being activated by the hamburger icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&#39;s everything is hidden behind the Yeah, but this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is becoming really common. I think even on desktop. It&#39;s just the normal. Visual queue is, where&#39;s the three lines? Okay. That&#39;s where all of the site navigation is happening inside of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And there&#39;s a point to make on that. I&#39;ve listed it there on the hamburger, so Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you&#39;re getting that, but you typically find those on the mobiles anyway, to save space on those. we&#39;ve got breadcrumbs of course. Which is a sort of sub menu. But then when we get to dropdowns, Terminology again, gets, drop as two separate words with a hyphen between it or to join together for one thing, but also we&#39;ve got other terms for this, but drop down on hover, which which is a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can do that with CSS can&#39;t, you can actually hover over Oh yeah. That&#39;s quite common. Yeah, it is quite common. But it&#39;s also terrible because keyboard users are completely lost. They can&#39;t use it any longer. They can&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Access it. Yeah. So it&#39;s not accessible. And then we&#39;ve got, so the dropdowns on click, which is obviously the better thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropdowns on hover is often there, but creates all sorts of usability issues anyway. Which we&#39;ll move on to. Dropdowns on click and hover. So both will operate. We&#39;ve got adjacent icons, concealing a dropdown to a sub menu of a main item, which can be confusing, which also can be activated by the main item on hover or click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got. All these possible combinations of things about how that could use, how it could work, even though it looks the same to the user. then we have of course the nested or multi-level dropdowns, which I think are dying away now because of mobile, difficulties with that one, where they used to fly out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; seem to be more in like the, dropdown, something akin to accordions, don&#39;t we? So things are nested beneath other things, especially on mobile. It&#39;s just one thing under another. It doesn&#39;t fly out in a separate, yeah, slightly. I don&#39;t know. Floated right? A little bit. That&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be happening quite as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, no, we used to say a lot of that. And then we got the mega menu, which was supposed to be, oh boy. Solution to all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Mega menus can be like an entire website. Fully take over the entire viewport where Yes. And in a sense you just think, what do I do with that? Just so many choices. And how would you navigate through that with, with the tab key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally don&#39;t know so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. again, if you go down the route of, a proper application and use menu, you can use Arrow key. So it is potentially possible to do it, but a lot of work with JavaScript, yeah, so we&#39;ve got that and terminology, haunts us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again here, Hayden Pickin points out in, oh, I forgot what it was. I think it&#39;s accessible components, a sort of a book of his, that dropdowns is the behavior we&#39;ll get with HDL Select and options, so that&#39;s really where that term&#39;s used. And so some people also refer to &#39;em as pull downs. Yeah, it&#39;s an older term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if we go to the W three C&#39;S web accessibility initiative, they refer to them as. Flyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So you see, that&#39;s fascinating. That one I&#39;d never even heard. I probably have some vestige of a decade or more ago, but it&#39;s a long time since I&#39;ve seen anybody talking about flyouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. And that&#39;s, I&#39;m just for those There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flyout leads, these are flyouts according to them. So we have a terminology issue again there. We really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do. Yeah. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I wanted to list those just because I think, I dunno if you, so I do, I found the, I when I, I. Die a little inside when I see a dropdown menu, even a hamburger on a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that my options are hidden and I have to hit this thing, which I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen with it or might drop down too far. I hate that I&#39;m not on the mobile phone much, but even on the desktop, I really hate the fact that I don&#39;t know if this top link I&#39;m on is clickable or whether it is a button to open up a menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s got an icon next to it, whether, unless that animates, whether that&#39;s the place with the Submenu or what I&#39;ve just hovered over it is the submenu. I actually get confused myself. Yeah. And I know how these all work. Yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you&#39;ve taken a really interesting approach with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Website, the no script show one where you&#39;ve essentially decided that all the menus are just gonna be in the footer, for want of a better word. And yeah, you jump link to that. If you click what might have been considered, I don&#39;t know, the, menu that flies in from the side on a mobile, you&#39;ve just jumped right into the footer In a, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a much more accessible way. I like that. That&#39;s good. go. If you&#39;re listening to this or watch it, it go and check it out. It&#39;s cool. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; in part two we&#39;ll just discuss it &#39;cause okay, yeah, of course. Yeah. I&#39;ll just discuss the markup on it. So we&#39;ll do that. okay, so let&#39;s have a look. We will talk about the code needed, &#39;cause we did that before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last one, when we&#39;re talking about accordions, that&#39;s needed for navigation. So straightforward. So HTML is gonna give us. All that we need in terms of semantics and accessible name. So we have the nav element, which is a landmark, and then if we put our A tags in a ordered or unordered list, then we&#39;re pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s gonna work. Yeah. That&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; more or less all you need in air quotes. Yeah. Nav followed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; by a list of As. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And for accessibility, screen reader is going to read out, the number of items. So it&#39;s quite helpful there. if we add in Aria, then we&#39;ve got a, more accessible way of being able to add more navigation components to our pages because we can label those up as, main navigation, secondary navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anybody who wants a, an overview of the page, the table of contents to get around, they&#39;ll be able to see that. And also with Aria, we can tell the user who&#39;s using the screen reader, which is the current page that they&#39;re on. Yep. Yep, So, that improves it. And obviously with CSS then we can have, beautiful horizontal rather than the standard sort of, vertical lineup that you would get with just HTML and where we can also indicate current page as well with that, by putting an underline when you&#39;re on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if we add in JavaScript, then that allows us to create interactive show and hide, which is. Generally that term, which we used last time as disclosure widgets, something where it&#39;s hidden is that sort of technical term, but that&#39;s where we introduce all these many different ways to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So can I ask a question at this point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got four things which increase? So number one is a given. So this nav with a list of As Yeah, that&#39;s the, basics. Then we&#39;ve got, we add in area for making it more readable. Yeah. CSS comes in and then JavaScript. So there are four things that we can do. Which of those are you, are you attempting to use for, in most cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are you, I&#39;m guessing you are gonna stop at the third one, the CSS one and ignore the JavaScript one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Okay. That&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking if I can, or the, conclusion I&#39;ve come to this, if I can get away with not using JavaScript, I save myself a lot of potential usability if I can get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With being able to show the, content in the correct order, then we get away from all of the difficulties that come with show and hide, I think. And, when you say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; sorry, when you say get away with what, is that a client coming to you with a particular feature or that they&#39;ve described that they want something which only really JavaScript could handle, so show hide for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you know what, or is it driven by more your own head? oh, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if, because I had a feeling that you would always stop at the CSS points. You would never stray into the JavaScript point ever basically these days. But maybe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you do. I have done, and I&#39;ll show that. Okay. Actually, in the second part, I&#39;ll show you where I mimicked with dialogue a, mega menu, which I did for a client, which I thought was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. But, I&#39;ll talk about that later. but yeah, it&#39;s interesting because I did have a cl I have had a client and it was. Probably the most difficult project that went on for just years and years, who had a very specific idea about how things should open up on this menu. And I had to get somebody in who knew JavaScript to do what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And effectively, I took myself out the equation and let them talk to the, and they were so upset because of course they, they hadn&#39;t been able to explain. Two, the JavaScript person gave &#39;em exactly what they asked for, but they hadn&#39;t worked out that, oh no, this is supposed to close when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. But on top of that, what they didn&#39;t know about that was the fact that, and I wasn&#39;t so aware as I am now, is that of course they hadn&#39;t thought about the usability for keyboard users. For screen readers, for any of those things. So yeah, generally I will avoid, Java, no script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it&#39;s a bit of a giveaway, isn&#39;t it, that we try to avoid. Yeah, yeah. I already mentioned the little subnote here that we can hover with CSS &#39;cause by saying that we can show in hide, we can do it with CSS, but keyboard users can&#39;t use that. So it&#39;s not, accessible and it&#39;s difficult as well on touch devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re on a mobile, it doesn&#39;t necessarily always work if you use hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so now a slew of four different problems that we can have in terms of, navigation. So UX design, SEO, accessibility. Let&#39;s start with ux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Gosh, yes. So ux. I think the, points I&#39;ve put here and the menu bars often look similar, but behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s my experience with going to, home about, I don&#39;t know if something&#39;s gonna drop down, how it&#39;s going to drop down. Yeah. Whether I click on the top thing or the sub menus, blah, blah. Confusing. we can&#39;t click on things we cannot see, which I think is one of the biggest faults of hide and show with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that, If, I don&#39;t know, there were some dropdown stuff there visually. I&#39;m not going to go to it, so I&#39;m gonna miss those pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So this is, where mega menus come in because they show all the things, but equally they then give us a bit of overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; presume&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it as, as long as, there&#39;s a mega menu there, so if it&#39;s combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Okay. As often is, do you know it&#39;s, so you can easy, if it&#39;s not there in front of you, you&#39;re not gonna click on it. So I think that&#39;s a bit of a problem. Okay. e easy dropdown solutions make LOP sloppy. Site architecture easy too. And that&#39;s from my own experience of working with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because working with WordPress, it makes it so easy for you to have the sort of menus that you want with various dropdowns. But of course, working with other people who don&#39;t want to do the thinking about how things are laid out, they can just drop anything wherever they like. And that&#39;s solved. Its up in the menu somewhere, so you get all sorts of bizarre stuff going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some really confusing stuff goes on with menu. Sometimes what&#39;s in a dropdown is not what you expect,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And it&#39;s also very, that the interface of WordPress makes it just trivially easy to drop in possibly. Yeah. Too much. Or nest things within nested things. And before you know it, you&#39;ve got this collapsing menu of nine different layers and on the back end it, that&#39;s just offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not use it? There&#39;s no, no hint that&#39;s weird on the front end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. We need to really indicate that our links are what they are and what they do. If they go to an external site, there should be some clue. There&#39;s usually a, visual thing, which I&#39;ll show in part two. Yeah, that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; very, I, you tend to see that on obsessively H-T-M-L-C-S-S focused websites, Yeah. But, not much elsewhere. Yeah. if you really don&#39;t see that being deployed broadly across the internet, an external link is just, it&#39;s guesswork. If I click this, what&#39;s gonna happen? No idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; luckily screen readers will largely announce for them, but it&#39;s for your sighted readers and PDFs as well, and uhhuh, other things that people put in their menus, they should indicate what you are gonna get when you click on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s so annoying if you click on something you think you&#39;re going to ion within the site and you are downloading a PDF before you and you&#39;re in some sort of silo that you yeah. drop down on hovers can interrupt a user&#39;s journey to another target. So often, there&#39;s some articles about this and you just think, again, this is a complication when you&#39;re hiding and showing in, you are heading off to one part of your menu, but you touch the other part of it and it opens up instantly if it&#39;s an instant hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the solution that people invent, and this is where you think things are getting complicated, they think, let&#39;s delay this. That&#39;s at a half, half a second delay here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yes. I, can&#39;t remember the name of the website, but that this has happened to me on multiple occasions and it&#39;s profoundly annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because in some situ, I really can&#39;t remember, but there, I have had a situation where I literally couldn&#39;t overcome that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; In that I was on a device of sufficient width that my mouse could not get to where it needed to go unless I took this very precise kinda one pixel route around things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I do. Yeah. And, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just some confection of the, width of my device that I was using and the, the way that I was currently located. Yeah. This is, and again, you&#39;re solving it with a weird JavaScript based time function. Just let&#39;s add half a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;ll fix it. yeah, it will, but maybe there&#39;s an underlying problem there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well. Yeah. And, not, when you think about it, you, a lot of the reason you want this to be available there is because it, people don&#39;t like to click onto a new page &#39;cause they have to wait for it to load. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause of all the JavaScript you put in your menu. But, these days, I think, we can get faster loading sites, so why not just go to flipping new page if you, have to delay someone&#39;s hover, it&#39;s you think we just lost the plot a bit with this, I&#39;m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; guessing from all of this that you don&#39;t do not like hover, you want click in all the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right? That&#39;s what I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; do. Yeah. Okay. and I was very, I, do this practical accessibility course with, Sarah Erda, which I&#39;ll mention &#39;cause there&#39;s some of our examples I going to use there. And she&#39;s another one who hates, what she says she advises against any hovering, but of course it&#39;s common, hover and click give everybody everything Anyway, so that&#39;s one problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we&#39;ve got so many here. The hide and show, can also should not obscure important information that people, I, it&#39;s one of the, it&#39;s one of the rules actually that come with accessibility is that you&#39;re not to obscure. And that&#39;s quite difficult to do that with a lot of the menus that we have that pop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&#39;t really, it&#39;s, I think it&#39;s a violation of wagg if you have what you commonly see as one of those navigations that pop up and take over the whole screen. I think it is, I think that&#39;s a violation of, okay. Oh, So becoming important because this week is one, this is the where, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where accessibility laws coming in. So we&#39;ve got that. disclosure, widgets have an interaction cost. Of course, if you&#39;re hiding and you&#39;re showing something, somebody has to go and click on it. it&#39;s extra work for them to do and that annoys me. If you don&#39;t need to, when you go to mobile and you don&#39;t need to click on something, you shouldn&#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s almost standard to force you to click. And that dear listener, was only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the UX bit got three sections to come. They get progressively smaller. This is just me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; ranting, isn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it? Yeah, no, it&#39;s great. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so design issues now. there is a good article there, which I won&#39;t go to, which is, really my sentiment about, this, that it&#39;s feeling like a tire design pattern now drop down menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it&#39;s, I didn&#39;t, did I mention this earlier, in this chat, or did it, was it before we recorded? But I was saying that I think, in a way that we copied. Print to our detriment. We&#39;ve copied, if you like, the menus that are in programs to our detriment when it comes to designing navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We definitely didn&#39;t add that in, to this. Yeah. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we did talk about it prior to hitting record. Yeah. And that&#39;s, think you&#39;re right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where I&#39;ve come to with this. And I think a lot of people, if you look a lot, modern designs are avoiding that. But, so much dropdowns anyway. So I think it&#39;s probably something where we have no idea how the web&#39;s supposed to look, and we&#39;re creating it as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we copy print in terms of our design, and I think we&#39;ve also copied in terms of menus, preexisting desktop programs and applications as a way of dealing with menus. And I think, we&#39;re starting to move away a bit from that. But there are some, head turn in examples, which we talked about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of &#39;em, which is so copied, is Stripe. Oh. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the menus in particular, I think it&#39;s the product one. You hover, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:56] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Look at that. for those people who can&#39;t see, there were just so many options. they are subcategorized, and again, you&#39;ve got this issue. If you&#39;re on your way to something, you&#39;ve got interruption because I&#39;m a hover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s that. But honestly, is this the best way? it is wonderful. Technically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; brilliant. Oh, beautiful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementation, like absolutely majestically gorgeous to look at. But yeah, there&#39;s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m a, Stripe user and I have no idea where to find what I&#39;d be interested in here. I just want to know what I mainly use it for ticking money off people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just gimme a link and a page that does that. No, what&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; curious there is they don&#39;t have a search feature embedded No. In their header, which is often the case, isn&#39;t it often these days you&#39;ll find search in the main navigation area, if not necessarily in the main navigation. Yeah. But they&#39;ve relegated search either to that menu, so hopefully they&#39;ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;ve given you enough to navigate to it, or maybe they&#39;ve just off offloaded that task to Google. They&#39;re hoping that you will choose the right set of keywords, which will deep link to whichever page you actually need from Google as opposed to doing it themselves. you can see what their intention, they&#39;re clearly trying to make it really so that you can get to wherever you want to go in, in one amazing menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is a lot to take in, isn&#39;t it? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and it I don&#39;t really understand the icons and the fact that they changed their styling from one to the other, I find a bit confusing. Anyway. One of the things that I did notice on this, &#39;cause the first thing I did see is this progressively enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your JavaScript fails to load for this, the only thing you can get to is the pricing. Interesting. So there&#39;s not a lot in terms of progressive enhancement there. There&#39;s none. No. If the JavaScript fails, you&#39;ve no menu other than the ability to pay for something because it&#39;s the only one which does not have a, some sort of hover state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. there&#39;s that. So I think I&#39;ve just twitched on one of my other points there. Design. da Let&#39;s have a look. yeah, my thoughts are, and this is where I can just maybe just show for those who are on YouTube, what we&#39;re doing, but I&#39;ll, oh, you&#39;ve done such a good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; job with this, I noticed this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so nice. it&#39;s actually view transition. Yeah. Actually I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t jump onto this yet. View transitions I think is really interesting because I think it&#39;s allowing us to, it&#39;s the, API that Yeah. Is supported now in safari. So I think it&#39;s about 87% support for view transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s definitely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the way it&#39;s gonna be done. It&#39;s so graceful. It looks so nice. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. And people are making like, carousel, not carousels, galleries and stuff where you&#39;re going from one page to the other. And one thing I never noticed until this, is that I was thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entirely different topic of tabs, but I was looking at YouTube and I thought when they have their tabs on YouTube that these were actually tabs, but I noticed that they take you to a different page. They take you to a different URL. So I think, yeah, I was surprised. Yeah, I looked at the, I don&#39;t realize that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh. no. You think it&#39;s tabs, but actually the pattern is tabs. But actually you are changing your URL, and I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to move a little bit towards, I think, instead of. And particularly if combined with speculative loading, which again is new and experimental, but that allows you, it allows you in the, sort of moderate form to say if someone hovers over this link here, it will start to pre-render the page or preload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose Yes, which way you want to go. Yeah, exactly. Yes. and you could just do that for two pages so it&#39;s not overwhelming your servers. So, I think, but isn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it interesting how profoundly un jarring it is. So it, so I should probably explain. View transitions combined with speculative loading view transitions enables you to let&#39;s go with the example of fade from one page to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of this hard reload where everything for a brief moment just goes, boom, it&#39;s gonna be, I can show you this. Yeah. Let&#39;s see. An action. So if you click on that, it may be this, the way that we&#39;re capturing the video for this recording, it won&#39;t, work so well because we&#39;ll probably have a sort of fairly poor frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you actually go to what David&#39;s looking at, and click around, there&#39;s this fade between, there you go. That was a lovely example. And combine that with speculative loading. I know it&#39;s nothing because really all that you&#39;re doing is, happening in the blink of an eye, but it, there is something far more aesthetically pleasing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just something Yeah. Like it&#39;s required now. I feel that&#39;s how it ought to be. &#39;cause it just feels, look at that. It&#39;s just so nice. Honestly, we&#39;re really getting in the weeds there, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But I think menus might be able to go that way. I think, if you&#39;ve got a big section of stuff like the services, a transition that&#39;s beautiful into a new page, I think, now that you can perhaps with speculative loading, make that page load so instantaneous that, and you can glide between it in an app-like way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. I think that&#39;s gonna change a lot of things. let me find my notes. Yeah, back up. There you go. Just there. So yeah, so that&#39;s my thinking. That might be the way forward with design on this one and, oh yeah, on our menu. So let me just move that. so I&#39;ve just added onto this. So we&#39;ve got a few items we need to put in our menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for those people just listening to that. But we have a basic home. And then for our different types of content, we&#39;ve got chat, learn, build, and then we&#39;ve got a more, which I&#39;ve now put little icon on. And when you hover over it, slightly changes, but just to make sure, I&#39;m just going to reload. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m just going to reload and then hover down to that. And what I&#39;ve done is it is got a second menu in the footer there, but because there&#39;s stuff that isn&#39;t more navigation, I&#39;ve actually put on the target a bit of animated. So with CSS we can animate the target, the place you&#39;re going to. So I put a little box around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I dunno if you saw that. I could see that. That was fabulous. Yeah. Yeah. But if I go back and refresh this, oops. I&#39;ll just go back and refresh this. So it, the target is only showing when, you actually click. When I&#39;m on the more navigation, so it&#39;s, it looks normal, so I just think, I&#39;m not sure what else you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really. If you&#39;ve got all your menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there and you can, there you go. and you can imagine a scenario where somebody like Stripe has all of that information. I don&#39;t know, very deep down on the page, but you click on the menu item and it takes you to it, and it would be. I can imagine very smooth and interesting ways to do it, especially with the dreaded Java script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I like what you did there a lot. I thought that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so I, it&#39;s made me think that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll go with this, for as much as I can. there will, I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be circumstances I haven&#39;t thought about where that&#39;s just not gonna work. But I just think the combination of, I fear before was making it ever present because page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think we can make them quicker and we can do nice effects to those pages. And then combined with this other idea of connecting to different navigation, so everything&#39;s present all the time, you&#39;ve not gotta worry about the next thing that we&#39;re talking about, SEO, which is the fact that JavaScript can possibly, we don&#39;t know Google say otherwise most of the time, but might create some search issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding something may mean that it&#39;s not found by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I guess really if, there&#39;s even a chance that it&#39;s not gonna be found, it&#39;s. Probably not worth it. It&#39;s like you said, if it&#39;s hidden, you can&#39;t click on it. If it&#39;s, yeah, not, if it&#39;s only visible with JavaScript who Google may not see it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; is it worth the risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the SEO people do all these experiments and claim that things aren&#39;t quite, as Google might say, and Google also say, I think when they talk about anything that&#39;s hidden behind JavaScript, is that they will view that as secondary content. If you don&#39;t want it to be seen immediately, then that&#39;s their take on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;ve hidden it away for a reason. So it&#39;s secondary. So it will have less of importance according to what I&#39;ve heard them say. I&#39;m no expert on this. So to think about, and of course, Obviously important to SEO is getting lots of clicks. People going to different pages is a good thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we&#39;re gonna hide our content, that&#39;s gonna lead to less clicks. Also, if we&#39;re making them just find those links rather than go to them quickly. slowing down our number of clicks, obviously. So I think there&#39;s some SEO. Okay. Considerations, accessibility. Last one. Yes. it&#39;s straightforward until we get to disclosure widgets showing and hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it just goes beyond my abilities and I think most to I. Get the JavaScript right for this. But most checkers, accessibility checkers, they can&#39;t because they&#39;re not working interactively. They can&#39;t pick up on the now failures that most sites, to be honest. I started looking at sites now with a new view and pretty much every navigation I came across was bloody awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it&#39;s really big names. I, know you know about this because you&#39;ve got Yeah. Joe Dolson, haven&#39;t you? Yeah. That&#39;s his name. And you&#39;ve been doing series That&#39;s right. Yeah. With him. and he is been looking at menu, so yes. that&#39;s it. So there is one thing that I thought was interesting &#39;cause we talked about it last time with accordions, is the fact this new ability with details and summary, HTM l to be able to let that do the JavaScript work for us as disclosing, but it technically, it is possible to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it be accessible. The problem is with it is how various screen readers and their combinations with various browsers decide to announce it. So they won&#39;t announce the disclosure triangle. They will say that it&#39;s a, what it is, that it&#39;s details and some just to wanna mean it. Oh, yeah. So it, it&#39;s not ideal at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I see a lot of accessibility experts testing it out all the time to see if that might be an option for the future. So if we wanna drop down maybe details in summary, maybe the way, but at the moment it seems like a, bad idea. and, Yeah, as I covered before, I think if we use the role of menu, which a lot of people do, there&#39;s we have to add in the support for using space Escape Arrow, all things that we don&#39;t get when we&#39;re just with our links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s generally, I think 99% of the time, I think usability experts will say, don&#39;t bother there unless you&#39;re building a desktop app. Don&#39;t get into that. But there is a great example if I just brought this up, lemme just, yeah, that it, the, third tab along was the one that, yeah, loaded. I got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is this accessible menu which is on accessible dash, mega dash menu at Netlify app. I don&#39;t know the people behind it, but they have done all this where you&#39;ve got all their shifts, tab space, enter escapes home, and then all of these keys will work on there. Quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Menu here. And yeah, I looked at that and honestly I couldn&#39;t have differentiated it from the Stripe one visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously they haven&#39;t leaned into all the icons and the border radius and the, all of that. But it&#39;s got, it&#39;s all there, right? Every single thing is there. But I, did wonder how much, of a tax in terms of time, this was probably rather a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. And, also, you go this route, I mean I wouldn&#39;t be using it if I just borrowed it and tried to use it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s using in tailwinds something that wouldn&#39;t want does CSS but also even even though this is perfect, it may have some things that will confuse people. So people often when you get an open up here, they might be expecting, &#39;cause they dunno what mode they&#39;ve gone into after to have closed. So effectively they screen readers will have gone into a sort of desktop menu type Reading of it. So maybe it&#39;s not such an issue, but for those who are not, you might expect to see a close because you&#39;re not expecting, you can now use your keyboard to get outta this. Interesting, okay. So there&#39;s a legacy problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there that&#39;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. it still can confuse some users. Yeah, Which, however perfect this might be. and difficult to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it. I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&#39;s, so essentially what you&#39;re saying, David, is there&#39;s no right way of doing any of this. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. so conclusion,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Conclusion is, I&#39;ve, given it, no surprise for our show that I think wherever possible we shout that I&#39;ve written here, should, avoid scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, if we can get away with our navigation with simple HTML and CSS, it makes life a lot easier. I dunno if that&#39;s always possible, but we&#39;re definitely gonna try for that. No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. who would&#39;ve thought a, show called the No Script Show? Who would&#39;ve thought they&#39;d avoid using a script? but you&#39;ve also made a couple of links there to, the Web Accessibility Cookbook, which is available as a, I guess Kindle, but as well as, a regular paper book in many, different formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also the, course that you&#39;ve been talking about recently, rather a lot actually. The Practical Accessibility course. Yeah. Some links, over at no script show slash 21 just navigate to the bottom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and there they all are. We&#39;ll talk about this &#39;cause I&#39;ll show some of the examples when we go to our YouTube section, but I think probably for the audio we&#39;re done, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. In that case, I will bid you farewell and we will see you very soon for the sort of code example session. So thanks David. That was fascinating. Yeah, enjoyed it. Thanks. Bye bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accordions-with-js&quot;&gt;Accordions with JS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowed from Sara Soueidan’s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://practical-accessibility.today/&quot;&gt;Practical Accessibility&lt;/a&gt; course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical approach using &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/yyLQmQZ/26d304b2094c87136a61a0b7cf12de18&quot;&gt;HTML buttons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accordion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/SaraSoueidan/pen/raNoXWr/b84fe6faa8823d00347532f428677044&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;interactive headings&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (progressive enhancement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-page search issues may be solved with the new hidden=until-found attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disclosure-widget&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/disclosure-widget/&quot;&gt;Disclosure widget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With details the browser has a built-in shadow DOM component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;details-content has browser styles set to content-visibility: hidden which changes to block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styling the marker is &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/using-styling-the-details-element/#aa-style-the-marker&quot;&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exclusive-css-accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intrinsicframework.here24.co/css-exclusive-accordion/&quot;&gt;Exclusive CSS accordion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &#39;open&amp;quot; to keep any panel open.&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details open&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a matching name attribute we get an exclusive accordion. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details name=&amp;quot;anyname&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can fix the height and allow scroll (Adrian Roselli’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/aardrian/pen/gOqdaXQ&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our example I have borrowed the mock icon from &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/learn/html/details/#toggling_the_summary_marker&quot;&gt;web.dev.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In page search works.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This video is a follow up to our podcast episode on website accordions. If you want to find that, you can at no script show slash 20. Here though, we&#39;re looking at some example accordions and their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the links for these are going to be at no script show slash learn. Forward slash 12. So I should say the 20 in the previous URL was the digits two zero and the 12 in this URL are the digits one zero. So no script show slash learn slash one two. There you go. Hello, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello. Yeah. So yes, we&#39;re putting all the links that go to our code on this one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve just got things we discussed because if you listen to the audio, one, we have a little site where we&#39;ve got our little code snippets so people can use them and their own projects is they want, which we&#39;ll try to. Prick, this library of them. So let me go back. this one should be a fairly quick one, really as we&#39;re going through the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, I will just say, &#39;cause I wanna give a shout out to Sarah Dan, I dunno if I ever say her name correctly. but I am a student doing her practical accessory and I will, I&#39;m gonna look at a bit of code that she&#39;s done, but she is, this is. Fabulous. If you want to get into accessibility, it&#39;s not cheap, but it, is really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she updates it and she&#39;s updated it to talk about accordions recently. So that&#39;s how we know end. So I just wanted to, if we were building in with JavaScript, which as we decided earlier when we were talking about it, we probably wouldn&#39;t use that and find other patterns. But if we did, she has a couple of great examples, which I&#39;ve included here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actually I didn&#39;t need to open here &#39;cause I&#39;ve got it over here. Where there is this typical, this is a code pen example that she set up here, which is I think how most of the accordions have often been done, where we are using a button. as the header to open up the content on this and JavaScript is then opening those up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she&#39;s done on this is one of the things that we discussed earlier is that she&#39;s got this, that the, it&#39;s progressively enhanced, meaning that, it&#39;s the CSS. if, sorry, if the JavaScript doesn&#39;t load, it&#39;s okay. We&#39;re going to get covered because these are all gonna be open by default. So that&#39;s one of examples and I&#39;ll just quickly mention another, because there is a situation where you might, as we talked about before, might want inter interactive headings as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want, because these are in buttons, they&#39;re not treated as headings. They are actually buttons with text in it. So if we want a header, she does have another example over here where she&#39;s doing exactly the same. So it&#39;s progressively enhanced, but the code is in a heading and we can make them what they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, this will work. So it&#39;s gonna show up on the table of contents for a site. So that&#39;s probably more useful, For a frequently asked questions. Yeah, and you want the headings to be there. There is an interesting thing though, as we mentioned on the sort of audio side of things, is the fact that you can&#39;t do in page search to find things with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a new thing, which you made me aware of, which I can just find in her code here. Little bit further&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; up, I think go up, up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s a little bit further. We have something that says, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; now you can&#39;t find it, but it is roughly there. You can&#39;t find it there. You could probably do eight now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve gone too far. I&#39;m pretty sure. I&#39;m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; sure it&#39;s down. da duh. Oh, yes. There we are. So we have what&#39;s coming in. She&#39;s brought Hidden Until Found, which is a new property, which will allow something to remain hidden where you&#39;ve put that in to. hidden is in the HTML, which actually is the same as display none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then things can&#39;t be found. But you&#39;ve got hidden until found, which solves this problem of in page searches if you wanna go JavaScript route. So I just wanna say that, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re looking at mainly today. let&#39;s go back to our notes here. I&#39;ve set up these examples and I thought the best way to understand how to put an accordion together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using just HTML and CSS, which we&#39;re trying to do on this is, to look at the basic details and summary, which allow us to do that. Good. Yeah. And that is on its own, disclosure, which is, so I&#39;ve created one, and we&#39;re actually using this. If we look at our transcripts now, we&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve actually got this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of thing going on with scrolling over here. Really nice. and we need to just quickly, so this is what you get out the box if you put in the code of details and summary. In fact, lemme, if I can show you this and we&#39;re having some problems with the browser for some reason why we&#39;re recording this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped working and started to complain. But if we look here, we&#39;ve got the details in our code. Yep. And we&#39;ve got our summary. But I believe, let&#39;s see what happens if I do this, if I delete this element. you see it&#39;s done what expected it actually. If you just use details and you forget to put the child in of summary, it will, or the browser will automatically still stick in the information, but it will give you the title of details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. that&#39;s a fairly decent attempt at. Yeah. Progressive enhancement I guess, if That&#39;s not, yeah. if you just forget, you get to do something. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; if your title is details, then you probably then you&#39;re fine. Need to bother. You don&#39;t. Yeah, you don&#39;t need, so it is got that little thing in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to do, and I&#39;ll need to refresh this again, I think too, just show this is important really what effectively, what the browser now has given us. Is a shadow dom component built in to the page so we don&#39;t have to bother with the JavaScript. And hopefully I can show this as it is. So there&#39;s no styling on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just the browser styling, creating the marker there. And as we can see here, it&#39;s seeing shadow root here, and this is where things failed when I go into the slot here. Yeah, snapped here. we get to see, what we need to see here is that in these slots we&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve given an. Id of details, dash summary on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is quite useful. We&#39;ve got, as we can see over here, we&#39;ve got the idea of that. We&#39;ve also got a pseudo element of details dash content, so we can style that kind of within our details. And we&#39;ve also got, which we have to build into our CSS. So we also have this content visibility hidden and display block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we&#39;re swapping, which we can&#39;t show &#39;cause it&#39;s just failed, I. When we are swapping from one position to the other, the JavaScript is going on there and it&#39;s swapping from that hidden to display block. Yep. As we need to do with JavaScript. So that gives us our basic element there so we can expand on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now adding in, a little bit of animation to that. So we&#39;re able to do this. And if I just go down to my code, actually let me step back one and quickly discuss this because it does look like I&#39;ve got some animation on my marker. It does. And we get a default marker and we can style this marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spec isn&#39;t, is a bit spotty. This is quite new at the moment. In theory, we should be able to replace this by using, marker to something else, but at the moment, we can only really style the color of it and the size of it. And know that&#39;s gonna work. you should be able to put in another bullet point list, but it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to recreate this, what I&#39;ve done and to put some animation on this &#39;cause we can&#39;t animate the marker, I&#39;ve actually just put it in here. my own SVG over here. Okay. Okay. Which is mimicking this. and then in that way on the CSS for this one, we can start it now. I&#39;m not going to, it&#39;s not on our site actually at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the default marker without the, this drop down. The reason being that the moment safari ignores the ability to hide the marker, we, can&#39;t do a marker display. None. And if I go down to the CSS on this. Somewhere down here. Have something on the marker there. On the marker there. Yep. So I&#39;ve given this its own label, I&#39;ve had to use content and then empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Empty on that one to get rid of it. Display. None wasn&#39;t working for me on this. Any version of that. And the problem is that, as I understand it at the moment far, is ignoring that. So it&#39;ll show the default marker. As well, but then I could rotate this. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, it&#39;s nice, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s it. The other thing I suppose to mention on here is that as I was trying to show before, we&#39;ve got this pseudo element of details dash content on here, and this is the thing that we can now take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the inside the. The details itself and animate this, and this is the really cool thing about this now, is that we can use, although it&#39;s only supported in chromium browsers, but will come that we can animate now we can do a transition from this content. So we&#39;ve got, let&#39;s just have a look on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I need to go up a little bit. you had transition behavior on the. Yeah, so we, here we are. We&#39;ve got the details, content. I need to go here. Got a block size of zero, so there&#39;s no height on the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. But when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we set it to open, open on the, yep. Yes. Then we can set it to a height, which I&#39;ve restricted at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I put block size of open, it would open to the full extent of the content. But what I&#39;ve done here is to. Restrict that. It&#39;s a little thing that I got from Adrian Rose who&#39;s a sort of usability expert, which thinks that&#39;s a lot easier sometimes just to, I really like it actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And the reason that I really like it is firstly, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it just, for something which is not extraordinarily long and you might want to dip into that content, that&#39;s perfect. But also the, invocation of the scroll bar, which in this case is stands in real great contrast to the background color. You&#39;ve got that purple scroll bar. It&#39;s so obvious that there&#39;s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. so it just works. I think that&#39;s a really nice way of doing it. Obviously, if it was like a whole essay that you were supposed to read from start to finish, perhaps not, you&#39;d just want the whole thing to open without the, in your case, REM of 15, the height, but that it works really well. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So you can set it on individuals if you like, because then you can you can just add in a class really and have it on which ones you want and which you don&#39;t. But I&#39;ve done this on our site, but because it&#39;s a progressive enhancement at the moment with, the stuff that you can do, it&#39;s not across all the browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I was to open this up and it was. Bigger than the content here in Firefox at the moment. It would just behave as you would expect. We wouldn&#39;t get the animation at the moment. And we just open up so the fact that it looks okay on arom browser there. It&#39;s great, but there is something to mention on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation that&#39;s opening up the panel is not possible unless somewhere we have, and we might as well put this in our reset. We have this interpolate size allow keywords, and this is limited at the moment, again to chromium, but should be, I think by the end of the year it should be available for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this allows us to style from a hidden content to an auto size. it, it couldn&#39;t be put into all browsers. We have to put it in ourself because it might break some other functionality that&#39;s already set up in CSS, I dunno the intricacies of that, but, effectively it&#39;s something we could put, I put it against the html, but I could just, put it against the whole, wherever you want to put it, but you might as well put it in your reset there &#39;cause it&#39;d be useful wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so that&#39;s it really. That&#39;s how it&#39;s put together. So we were able to animate, The inside is a progressive enhancement at the moment, and the marker, as I showed was something which I&#39;ve actually put in line with an SVG, a simple one here. Yeah. Which again, because of this, by default we&#39;ve got black and white here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s quite useful when you&#39;ve got inline SVGs to be able to do that because then you can set, a fill color. So we can see this is actually slightly changing too. My fill colors because I can now do this via the CSS if I think somewhere down here. Yes. We should see, I&#39;ve put it to our branding fill color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. Yeah. So the SVG. Yeah. So it&#39;s going to adapt to those two colors I&#39;ve got in there. Okay. Anything I you think I missed on this? No, I think that&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that&#39;s really useful. just wanna clarify, this will be able to be found at no script show slash learn, and then the number slash the number 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that where all this code is gonna end up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And then to get to the ex no, the, They&#39;ll stay on the intrinsic framework, which is a separate site, but the links will be there. Perfect. so you can just go click on this and it&#39;ll take you to the right page, because I need the intrinsic framework because there&#39;ll be lots of examples for each episode that we do, got it. And it&#39;ll get too big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I will, communicate with David and we&#39;ll make sure that all the links that need to go are in the show notes, be that on the podcast or be that on the, YouTube videos that come with this. Is there anything you wanted to show before we knock it on the head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, we&#39;ve still got the, we haven&#39;t got into the accordion bit yet. Of course we haven&#39;t. Apologies. No. Yeah. So we just need to, this is bringing them together. So we mentioned it in the audio that in order to it, for it to be accessible, we can&#39;t just dump a whole bunch of these different. Details and summaries together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can see it with styling if we have styled it, that they grouped together, but somebody who&#39;s on the screen reader can&#39;t. So it&#39;s pretty much building on the same thing here. We, we need to do something about that. And in this case, on the example that I&#39;m showing here, the first example here, I&#39;ve put this in a section of group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think there&#39;s a mistake in this. Let me just have a look at that. It doesn&#39;t actually matter, but I could use this as a diviv and give it a roll of group. Yep. And then I, a label of whatever group name I want, and then against the idea of group names, then I can put in that as hidden. That&#39;s using the H TM L version to hide it so you don&#39;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then whatever I need to save for the screen readers. Now, when it&#39;s in a group, when it&#39;s in a role of group, that actually should be a div there. So I think I&#39;ll change that. It won&#39;t be in the table of contents if we want it to show up in a table of content. So this would be good if you are accordion wanted to show, say in another section, and you don&#39;t want it to stand out as its own section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you would use the group role, but if we do want it to stand out as its own thing, then we&#39;ll put it in a section. Do exactly the same. Are we a label by? With whatever group label we want. Again, connecting this to a header with the idea of that group label. And then what I&#39;ve done here with CSS is I&#39;ve visually hidden this and there&#39;s a class, which I&#39;ll put down on the bottom here, how to hide this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a utility class that I use that hides it from cited, but still reads out to. Non-sighted people. What the lemme just see, go back there what the title is. So it&#39;d be group title, something saying this. I can demonstrate it. I&#39;m not on a Mac &#39;cause you get this automatically. But you can see, because I&#39;ve actually used this with a section, we can actually see that this group title that I&#39;m, is coming up under the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a screen reader Yep. Will be able to jump to it quickly. So you, again, we have to decide which one&#39;s the most appropriate one for where you&#39;re going to use this. so that&#39;s the key thing here. There are a couple of things here probably worth mentioning is that you just see on this group of different ones here, I&#39;ve, combined things, so I&#39;ve left this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you load the page as open, and if we take a look, it&#39;s pretty simple. We can decide which one&#39;s going to be open. Yep. By just actually putting it open by the details on here. Yep. And in order to make these work as a unit where one closes as the other&#39;s open as an exclusive. Exclusive, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Set up, what I&#39;ve done is given them a shared matching name, so for each of these details panels, we&#39;ve got the name, which I&#39;ve called any name at the moment, but it could be anything you want. And then that makes &#39;em work as a unit. One closes and the other opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, perfect. So if you add the name, and you make it the same across all of them, then they behave as one unit and will collapse ones that are no longer required, that are no longer in focus, if you like, that are open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. And I&#39;ve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; left this, normally I think I&#39;d have them all closed, but I&#39;ve put the first one as open by doing this, but this is exactly what changes in the browser with the interactivity it puts in open there for you. So I&#39;d probably leave that blank and have a more closed, let me just have a quick scout through this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS here. Make sure that I&#39;ve covered, in fact, I&#39;ll go back to my notes if you don&#39;t mind here. No, that&#39;s good. Yep. so I&#39;ve mentioned that opened. If you want to open, I&#39;ve mentioned that we will just add in any details of the name attribute that we want to put in there. scroll I&#39;ve mentioned. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mock icon. So we were talking about this earlier. You didn&#39;t like this pattern, did you? Much So I&#39;ve put it in as another example. So here we&#39;ve got another icon. But what&#39;s quite nice about this, and I&#39;ve stolen it from web dev and you&#39;ll see it in the CSS here, it&#39;s, we&#39;ve hidden the marker. Although it will reappear and there is a reason for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if an Apple user goes in there, they&#39;re probably likely to see the triangle as well as this. Okay? If I&#39;d have put the, as I did on the first example with the disclosure and replaced it with my own marker, I probably end up with two markers. And two markers, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Does that&#39;s only on Safari, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; think so. And it probably is fixed. Probably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; will get fixed at some point. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it may, be, by the time we put this out, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s just something that people have noticed. But, that on here, and I won&#39;t go into the details of it particularly, but basically we are just adding a board, a bottom to it, and an animation too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve removed the marker. And we floated it off over here. And essentially this is content zero with a border added to it, which then we rotate to show this. it&#39;s in web dev. I&#39;ve nicked that little icon. So it&#39;s a nice way of,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s interesting. Okay. yeah. So makes it like a, makes it look like a plus and a minus symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s, a nice little effect, but there&#39;s actually no icon used at all. So when you&#39;ve got color schemes, it&#39;s just gonna match. Whatever the color is in there. And that&#39;s included in the code there. But I don&#39;t think I can very well explain this one, but it should probably make sense when you look at this, when we&#39;re looking at the summary before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s setting this and there&#39;s our transform and it&#39;s moving and rotating from 90 degrees. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. When it opens, it rotates. Yeah. So yeah, so it&#39;s a, without an icon, we&#39;ve managed to get something that looks like an icon. But you are not a fan of that, do you? It doesn&#39;t feel instinctive to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; really, it&#39;s the position of it. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s, not really the, I quite like the icon. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s over to the right and the text, which is the indicator of what you want, is over to the left. So for me, I think combining the title, or in this case, the heading one, heading two, heading three, with that icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same location. Yeah. So in, in our case, if everything&#39;s floated left, that just feels like the right place to put it because if I&#39;m going to that, it&#39;s hard for me to work out. Okay. It&#39;s a heading, but where&#39;s, where is it? Oh, I see. There&#39;s a, there&#39;s an icon over on far on the right and your, viewpoint, there&#39;s quite constrained, what is that, 800 pixels or something along those lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. If it was full width, which I think it might be, it would be really easy, especially if you didn&#39;t have a background color. if there was nothing to visually indicate this is a whole row or a section I have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; put Yeah. Interesting. Because I have, when you hover over here, I have put a subtle dark in and actually Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; do that, I see it. Yeah. That makes it a little bit more obvious. And you&#39;ve got the, hand, icon as well. It&#39;s all Oh yeah. Something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to mention that you do. Yes. &#39;cause it&#39;s, horrible. I actually think with the default, unless you put Yes, the. The cursor to pointer is that you have to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one other thing I&#39;ve just mentioned that&#39;s in the CSS here &#39;cause I don&#39;t want to go into too much detail. People &#39;cause it, it&#39;s very likely to change. but I have used relative color here, which is getting about, I think about 97% support now at the moment to add the darkening. So whatever was the, The color that I&#39;m using the shade that I&#39;m using here. I&#39;ve darkened it with relative color, so I split up the channels and darkened it there and for the transition on how that comes in there. that&#39;s it really. Yes. The other point was, again, with this, with all of this, you need to make sure you&#39;ve got that interpolate size on there, and if you&#39;re hiding stuff, this is the stuff that you might want for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also another bit of code on here, which I won&#39;t demonstrate at the moment, but if you. With any of these boxes, if someone forces the color scheme or they&#39;re on windows and they use one of their themes that you use for high contrast, this will put an outline around it. So your, so they&#39;ll look like little boxes around your details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s nice. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s it. I think that&#39;s it. There&#39;s a lot. Yeah, so is there, I&#39;ll probably change the code as we go along. This would should, I&#39;ve put it as updated over here because where this intrinsic framework will be as I keep adding to it, there&#39;ll be content and we&#39;ll discuss it each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things change. And obviously I might change the CSS, but it&#39;ll be updated and it&#39;ll show the date here. So if anyone wants to use it for the projects, they might want to check out when it was last updated. But it might change from when we do the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, that&#39;s perfect. And, where would we be able to find this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the URL for Intrinsic framework? I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s on the intrinsic framework.here. No, is it.no here? 20 four.co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s, but don&#39;t worry, you just need to go to our learn on the No Script show and there&#39;ll always be links to an examples that are on this, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no script. Show slash learn slash the number 12 in ER rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and check that out. And that is the space to find it. If that&#39;s the case, shall we knock it on the head? That was brilliant. Learned all about new ways of, doing accordions, what they are, how they work. All in css, no JavaScript in site. I&#39;ve maybe a bit here and there, but, mostly no JavaScript in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, David. Yeah, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Website accordions: the good the bad and the ugly</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-an-accordion&quot;&gt;What’s an accordion?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection of (hide and show) disclosure widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A collection &amp;quot;headings&amp;quot; with icons which when triggered reveal a panel of previously hidden content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; some articles point to other UX patterns. Here we are not considering overlays or anchor links to page content as accordions.
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-accordions&quot;&gt;Types of accordions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive. This is when only one panel can be open at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non exclusive where the user can open how many they like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive or non-exclusive with an open/close all toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-needed-for-accordions&quot;&gt;Code needed for accordions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently accordions always needed JS and ARIA tags (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Jan  2020 we got the details and summary elements that allowed us make non exclusive accordions with only HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Sept 2024 we could add matching name attributes to the details elements to allow us to create exclusive accordions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want a open/close all toggle we still needs Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/interpolate-size&quot;&gt;Interpolate-size&lt;/a&gt; allows us to animate the opening of an accordion panel. It is still experimental and limited to chromium browsers, but is a progressive enhancement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-we-might-use-them-ux&quot;&gt;When we might use them (UX)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A condensed version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-on-desktop/&quot;&gt;recent articles &lt;/a&gt; from the Nielsen Norman Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving Scannability (less clutter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces scrolling (quicker access to specific content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can make some content easier on mobile. (large articles or long forms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downsides&lt;/strong&gt; (depending on use and implementation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased Interaction Cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragmented Access to Information (can’t compare panel content easily).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty with printing, accessibility, SEO and in-page search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;small&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKZjnqRsxzo&quot;&gt;Accordions on Mobile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility-considerations&quot;&gt;Accessibility  considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details and summary make things easier as the browser takes care of the interaction, state and role side of things, but to be accessible we can not just add a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need ARIA to tell the screen readers that these are grouped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if they need to be included in the page&#39;s table of contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if the accordion headings should be announced as regular headings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-considerations&quot;&gt;Design considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, we have more design control with JS, but more responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have a fallback for when JS does not load. Andy Bell lists 15 situations &lt;a href=&quot;https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available/&quot;&gt;where this can happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the design issues with using details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation is presently experimental or limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browsers marker icon has a limited styling option. We can remove it with content: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;; but Safari presently ignores that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detail and summary open up lots of possibilities. Bramus Van Damme has been doing some &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/styling-details&quot;&gt;cool experiments&lt;/a&gt;, but following Google accessible carousels that were less than accessible I think these may not yet be production ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seo-considerations&quot;&gt;SEO considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those using accordions dependent on JS might want to research beyond what Google says about being able to find hidden content, but as far as we know there are no issues with using details and summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonus with details and summary is that in-page search works and panels will open to show the highlighted text. (presently true for Chromium browsers but as part of interop it should be true for other before 2026).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordions are often used for FAQ pages. There&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt; for this, but probably only useful for bonafide health and government sites these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the no script show focussed doing the most with HTML  we would probably look to other patterns if JS was needed.  For example if there was a page with lots of content sections. We&#39;d probably follow what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; does by using anchor tags or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/partial-keyframes/&quot;&gt;Josh Comeau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/12/&quot;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt; 
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there and welcome to the No Script Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first in our series looking at various components that make up a website. Today we&#39;re gonna be talking about accordions. The format for this series is that we&#39;ll first talk about the components in terms of when they may be helpful in the light of UX or not, but also we&#39;ll be looking at them in terms of accessibility and SEO considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll also talk about the code needed. But as this goes out as an audio podcast, we&#39;ll also follow this episode up with a part two. This will be video content that looks at some code snippets and working examples. And as always, the person actually doing the real work is David Waumsley. Hello David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so hopefully this format will work. And I had this idea a long time ago, and I built this sort of site for my own use called the Intrinsic Framework. It&#39;s a bit of a joke name, I can&#39;t think what else to call it. Where I was collecting all these snippets I got from other people and, things that I might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we did our show builds, we did three of these builds. Basically, I used the same pile of snippets. So I thought what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll try and brand, that, that whole thing. To match with this so we can talk about stuff and then we can actually show some of these snippets as well that anyone can use if they wanna take away and use them or tell me where I&#39;ve got things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be helpful too. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;re gonna have two websites in effect. We&#39;re gonna have one with the content, like the stuff we talk about, the podcast, the videos, that kind of thing. But then also there&#39;ll be a, a. Different layer, the intrinsic framework layer where you can go and see how these examples work and find the code and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. So we, I mean we&#39;re, all putting it on the no script show. So we&#39;ve got, we, did it anyway. I did some solo videos, didn&#39;t I? Which we characterized as learn. There were short videos where we talked about code or I talked about code then on my own, but now I&#39;m gonna do it with you &#39;cause it&#39;s a lot more entertaining when I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, so we can actually bring up the show notes &#39;cause we have got some notes to talk around. Here we are. Okay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So this is gonna be available at no script show slash 20 if you want to get in touch with us. And today it&#39;s all accordions all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. The good, bad, and ugly. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t, it&#39;s a bit more like click bait, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That it is. yeah. So we&#39;ve got notes. So first of all, I guess we ought to start with defining what an accordion is. So I&#39;ve got a couple of. Definitions, if you like, which I&#39;ve seen from various places. One is that it&#39;s a collection of hide and show disclosure widgets, which is generally a sort of W three C kind of term for these things, disclosure widgets, and then other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people like the Nielsen Norman Group. Or is it Norman Nielsen Group? I always forget. Anyway, yes, the UX people, I think they would refer to it as a collection of headings with icons that when triggered would reveal a panel of previously hidden content and. I&#39;ve put a little note on this one actually, because I looked through a few articles preparing for this and talking about, design of our accord, accordions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a lot of those when I went to the example sites, and it could be that the example sites had changed, but they weren&#39;t actually what we would think as accordions where something drops down below. They were sometimes overlays, they were sometimes, just anchor text, go into somewhere else on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so for, this, we&#39;re really thinking of accordions as those, know, drop down. Kind of things, little disclosure, which is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. can I tell you what I would&#39;ve said prior to reading your show notes here? I would&#39;ve just said, yeah, basically it&#39;s a bunch of horizontal titles. Really? Yeah. And you click on it and then something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peers, usually with some kind of transition, like a slide out or something like that. And you&#39;ve got this option to open and close. Sometimes you open multiple, close multiple, have one open at a time, those kind of things. But I guess it comes from the instrument, doesn&#39;t it? That you know the accordion, like a piano with a squeeze box in between the idea that it gets bigger and gets smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it, but it goes sideways word, isn&#39;t it? Yeah, definitely go sideways as opposed to up and down, but I&#39;m imagining that&#39;s where it comes from anyway. But, always to do with JavaScript. There&#39;s always an element of JavaScript in there because things have been hidden and they need to be revealed in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that&#39;s, and that&#39;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and that&#39;s why we&#39;re talking about Yeah. Because we can now do it with HTML and CSS and have it accessible, but, nice. But, next thing I&#39;ve got here is obviously the types of accordion that we have. &#39;cause they do have names. I didn&#39;t know this. So an exclusive accordion is when, I think this is typical expected behavior of accordion that when you open one with a trigger or the heading a panel, the other ones will close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you only keep one open at a time. So they work as a group, but there is the non-exclusive. accordion where you can open as many as you like. and then we have the kind of inclusive or non-inclusive where there is an open and close or toggle where you can just open them all up or close them all up if you want, which is quite handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s curious,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; ju just thinking about it, it&#39;s curious that this is something that&#39;s become a normal design pattern. Because I&#39;m imagining when the browsers first started implementing things in HDML, that probably this wasn&#39;t even on anybody&#39;s radar. And then some, yeah. Some ingenious person thought, gosh, there&#39;s too much here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any way of making it less, getting rid of half of the content that we&#39;ve got, but somehow discoverable by the user. Yeah. And and now it&#39;s just a completely normal, accepted part of. I&#39;d imagine if you go to many websites, a significant proportion of them will have something akin to this somewhere, maybe as an FFAQ or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, anyway, carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. just thinking back to the, websites that you did for clients before, do you, did you use an accordion a lot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; quite often actually. And usually it was on the things like the FAQ kind of page where the whole point was that you wanted to put a ton of information on there, but you also wanted to make it so that the headings were the thing, not the actual content, and then the person could discover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I always implemented it with a kind of drag and drop page builder style solution. I don&#39;t think I ever built one. Outside of A CMS. So I didn&#39;t explore how the HTML was structured and the importance of that. It was always just a, drop in a widget or an, a block or whatever you, might do in the WordPress space, and then fill out the, available containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&#39;d have the title and then the, actual content. That was it. But there&#39;s way more to this, and obviously now that it&#39;s being done with just CSS, you&#39;ve gotta know what those bits are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I, same for me. Really? I don&#39;t think I used an accordion until I started using the page builder and then I overused them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now looking back, I can see I, it was there because you thought, oh, FAQ page. Yep. Of course I need an accordion. Here&#39;s one I can drag in. Yep. And it, yeah. Anyway, we&#39;ll, move on to that. Sorry I interrupted myself. No, that&#39;s okay. The code needed. Yes, that&#39;s what we&#39;re moving on. So this is the interesting thing really, is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really until recently, we always needed JavaScript and if we wanted them to be accessible, we would need to add Aria tags as well to those so screen readers can understand what&#39;s happening. But from January, 2020, we got the details and summary element that allowed us to make non-exclusive accordions effectively only with html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we don&#39;t even need the CSS, the browsers own, style sheets. We&#39;ll do what we want, That was great. From September last year, 2024, we could add matching name attributes to the details element that would allow them to work as one so we could create exclusive. So one would close as the other one would open as long as those names matched against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was a big move forward. And in terms of styling, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but just recently, and it&#39;s still limited at the moment we have, I always pause when I want to say this interpolate size, which is something which just come to CSS and what it does. is, I dunno if I can explain it well, but it, in that, the case of us, it allows us to be able to use CSS to size something that isn&#39;t seen that&#39;s hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when something is closed, if you like, you&#39;ve got nowhere of being able to do a transition to an open stage. And this will allow this to happen. Now, to be honest, we will get onto that when we get onto the CSS. It&#39;s a bit of code that you probably want to put in all your star sheets and your resets because they would&#39;ve just introduced this ability to do it, but it would impact on other CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have to add it in if you want this functionality, but it&#39;s one of these things that you probably likely to always want, so you would just stick it in your resets. but anyway, it does allow now for us to have a bit of animation when we open those tabs because. As it is. So suddenly we&#39;ve got something which is like the JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordions that we&#39;ve always known. There&#39;ve always been a little bit of animation there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just re just reprise that just to make sure I&#39;ve understood that. So prior to January, 2021, you needed JavaScript if you wanted to achieve anything akin to a, a ahy show state. Yes. Yes. So an accordion January, 2020, we got, details and summary, which allowed us to have a single element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could do multiple single elements, but they weren&#39;t in any way connected with one another. You would just have a detail and then the summary, and you click on the detail and the summary is open, but there&#39;s no animation. It just suddenly open, suddenly closed. Then in last year, that&#39;s surprising to me, September, 2024, you could now somehow bind them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could have multiple details, multiple summaries, and they would bind together so that you would open one and another would know that was open. So maybe another one should collapse. So all of a sudden. September, 2024, we&#39;ve got something which starts to feel a little bit more like the JavaScript accordions where they&#39;re interacting with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then finally, right now, interpolate, he said trying to get the word right size, is new. Maybe it&#39;s not widely accepted, but the idea there is it, can figure out that there&#39;s this zero sized thing Yes. And then expand it. And now we&#39;ve got the full range of things. It now feels like an entirely Java script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less accordion is available. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; There was no way to, to have the height goes from zero to, an auto size, which you would need to contain all of that stuff before this. And it&#39;s still not supported. it&#39;s only really on Therom browsers at the moment, but it will come to the rest. So I think we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guarantee that we&#39;ll be able to do this. Okay. There, there were, other ways, which I&#39;ll talk about later on that one. So let&#39;s, should we move on to Yeah. Why we might wanna use them? Sure. I&#39;ll bring up the article that I was looking at, which is from the, now it doesn&#39;t tell me whether it&#39;s Norman Nien, but the NNN group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&#39;s all helpful, isn&#39;t it? Yes. and there&#39;s some great examples on here. actually I&#39;ll go. I&#39;m distracting myself. I&#39;ll go back to, what we said were the main benefits. Can we just quickly go over this one? okay. What they list, and there&#39;s a few articles and I&#39;ve put links to them on the show notes here, but there&#39;s, the benefits is really improve scanability so there&#39;s less cut out on the page so that you&#39;ve mentioned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce. Scrolling, if you need to get to specific content so you can get there much quicker, and that it can make the content easier, particularly on mobiles when say you&#39;ve got long articles and you want different sections or the thing we were looking at earlier where we thought is useful, where there might be a step by step process that you go through, say with a form where you complete this bit and you want to open the next bit to complete the next bit, so there&#39;s not this big overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. The downsides which we&#39;ve got here, which will always depend on the use and implementation with this, is that there, there is for the user an increased interaction cost, so they have to keep clicking on stuff. there&#39;s fragmented access to information, so they can&#39;t compare. The content in, if they&#39;re gonna close, if it&#39;s exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. they can&#39;t compare what&#39;s in that, information. So that can get annoying. And then there&#39;s all the other difficulties that are there. most accordions out there when you look at them, don&#39;t function properly. but there are issues with being able to print out the content that&#39;s in an accordion, accessibility issues, which will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touch on data, and sometimes with SEO, with the, content is hidden and not easy to find, or not easy to find with an in-page search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. okay. So that would be a scenario where a, an accordion was collapsed. The dom shows that a certain string of words through search is somewhere on the page, but where the heck is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you, How do you locate it? Would you have to open that in order to click through the search to find it? Yeah. That&#39;s tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I&#39;ll bring up that article and apologies for those people listening to the audio only, but there&#39;s not much to see here. So there are a couple of quick examples, which I thought were, I&#39;ll just scroll down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These that they put in their article and I. The best use I, I think of is they show an example of the Logitech page where it&#39;s a typical product page where you&#39;ve got the main product on the left and on the right you&#39;ve got that thing where you&#39;ll add to cart and some basic details. But also there&#39;s a little dropdown of a, accordions there, where you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just get other information about the spec and details, compatibility, support and all that kind of stuff. But not everybody will want that to go to checkout. And if you were to put that in, that would be a lot of text. You wouldn&#39;t see the item you&#39;re going to buy. So I see this as a really good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It&#39;s interesting because on some checkout pages, you see the sort of the sister of accordions, which is tabs. So that&#39;s a horizontal layout. Yes. a similar idea. But this works much better in a sidebar, doesn&#39;t it? You couldn&#39;t do a taped interface for that content. But, but an accordion here works really well and it&#39;s curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause I just, that example, I would use that, I would definitely be clicking on the specs and details. Yes. But I don&#39;t wanna see the compatibility, the support, the, in the bot. I don&#39;t wanna see any of that. So having it collapsed and me seeing the option to go into the tech spec, that&#39;s exactly the way that I would like to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#39;s all just in the sidebar is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it solves that problem. And they say there&#39;s about sort of 10% of people who just need all the details. They can get the type of person who will investigate the footer in, for all the links and everything that, that type of person. And it&#39;s a way of bringing that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without, it makes it more available where it needs to be. So I can see the good use for interesting thing is though, on the Logitech, if you do go to that page now, I, imagine it&#39;s changed since they did this article, which is only a couple of years ago. But now if you actually go to that and you click on it, it doesn&#39;t open up a dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually. It does an overlay that comes in from, the right hand side. Oh, okay. Overall, yeah. yeah. oh, nevermind. Yeah, it&#39;s a good idea. Yeah. And the other example that they put here, which is from a site, which is Learn, HTML, where they use it to section up the sort of syllabus content that they might have there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might want to look at different things on the syllabus, and you can go into that. And that on a lot of articles as well, where there might just be. Not everything&#39;s gonna be of interest, and you want to. Just not overwhelm. so we have to scan down. So I could see that. So that&#39;s, there have got a couple of good uses, but I&#39;m guilty of, I&#39;m gonna scan down here to where I think the one that I&#39;m most guilty of doing is this one here on the Department of Revenue that they show where there&#39;s three accordions all closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you were to open those up as they show. Basically that&#39;s just a header and a normal, standard bit of text, which would just be a lot easier to scan through this, wouldn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gi given the amount of text there, I suppose a decision has to be made about whether there&#39;s any utility in having an accordion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of those thoughts is how much there is. And there&#39;s really not a lot. And because there&#39;s not a lot, why not just get rid of the, the accordion in the first place? Less interactions. But obviously if each of those were, I don&#39;t know, twice, three times the length that it is there. Then it suddenly does become useful because you&#39;re avoiding the scroll and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, I think in that situation I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;re using some kind of CMS and the CMS will probably have a field where they can dump that information and that information will automatically end up in a, an accordion, if Yeah. As opposed to a page by page analysis of should this go on accordion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should it not? So maybe it&#39;s the CMS, which is making the decision for them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve certainly gone to loads and loads of, obviously I think page builder sites where there&#39;s frequently asked questions and then literally the answer is just a couple of words. Yeah. Do you offer a refund and you open it up and the word is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It&#39;s so frustrating to after that interaction cost, yeah. Is, really a lot of the problem. and you take on a lot of issues, responsibilities for. how these things are gonna work to be accessible to all. Okay, let&#39;s go back then. So accessibility considerations. yeah, so we, so details and summary makes it a lot easier now for us to be able to create an accessible I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordion, but, we can&#39;t just stick a whole bunch of them together and leave it there. We do need to tell screen readers that this is a collection of items, so we do need Aria to be able to let them know that it&#39;s grouped, which we&#39;ll get onto. when we do the more video bit, but we need to tell &#39;em how that is grouped as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we need to decide whether that content or the content that is going to be included, whether the accordion itself is going to be included in the summary of the page and is content. So for screen readers, they get a summary whether they&#39;ll get the headers. So we have to bake that into it. And then we also have to consider should those accordions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have their own headers as such. So we would expect when we look at frequently asked questions, a lot of the time that these are actually headers. But if we&#39;re using accordion a lot of the time with JavaScript, we would put that in a button. And it loses all its meaning as a header. It can&#39;t be a header and a button at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and the same happens if we use summary within details. It&#39;s mapped to the button role. So if you, can put a header in it and stylistically, I think it will adopt that, but it loses its meaning as a heading. So there are those sort of considerations. About the type of content that we have for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. There&#39;s actually a lot there isn&#39;t there? And, becoming from a background of using a CMS and page builders and things like that, obviously you are, maybe they have the options for these kind of things, but probably not. Maybe most people wouldn&#39;t explore them. Just the fact that it puts the accordion on the page, you kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that job&#39;s done. Yes. But there is a lot there. aria are able to say that things are grouped. So if you&#39;re using just a single detail, so summary and details, you&#39;re, better, that&#39;s fine. But when you start to group them together in this way that we were describing earlier, you need to in some way indicate that these are group, they, form part of a wider group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then whether or not things don&#39;t need to go in the table of contents and, Buttons as headings and headings as buttons is also problematic. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You, you&#39;re always gonna need to put it in either a diviv, and you can give it a roll of groups so somebody knows. But ideally you add r we a label buy and then put that to a title, which you may or may not want to hide for sighted users, or if you want it to show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table of contents, we have to put that then in a section and do a similar thing. So it&#39;s quite interesting, all this consideration. So yeah, I doubt there would be a page builder, one-off, accordion that could. Swap to all of those different things. So probably, they&#39;re always going to be used wrongly in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But, nice to know that given the knowledge, which will impart, there&#39;s an answer for each of those problems. The considerations that&#39;s the right word. there&#39;s a way of doing it correctly. So that&#39;s good to know. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Design considerations. we talk about that. That there&#39;s obviously more design control that you&#39;ve got if you&#39;re going for a JavaScript approach than you can because there&#39;s some limitations with details and summary using it as an accordion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because as mentioned, we&#39;ve got this, Animation, but it&#39;s still limited at the moment, so that&#39;s not gonna work for everybody. We&#39;ve also got, and this is really interesting, I&#39;ll get into it more with the code, but the, we have the marker that we get by default. This little triangle. Yeah. Which changes if we just use H two ML and use the browser zone user agent styles, we get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outta the box. But when you wanna change it, it becomes quite tricky. You could do some global changing of color, in theory on the documentation, at least with web dev. It says that you will be able to replace that like any other marker and use like a bullet point, any of those listed, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are some still little quirks with that because even if you remove by using content and put those in quotes with nothing in it to remove the marker against the marker, It gets removed so you can add something else in. But that&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem to work on Safari browsers at the moment, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are, at the moment there are design considerations, but I think, they probably still make it for me, they make it worth looking to not have to deal with JavaScript and how that might fail for people and all the other considerations. I still think, we can design. accordions just with details and summary quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Okay. we said we&#39;ll take everything by SEO. There&#39;s not much I can say on SEO. I did a bit of research, to see what was being said about this. And as far as I know, if we&#39;re using details and summary, which is great, is the fact that search engines will be able to find the content that&#39;s within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will also, and this is the big bonus which we won&#39;t get with the JavaScript solution, is that we get. in page search, it will open up the tabs to find the content within those by default, which you won&#39;t necessarily, which it&#39;s difficult to achieve actually with JavaScript. So there are some benefits, I think, and I think also, there are different reports out there because the, bottom line I think with Google is, don&#39;t worry about your hidden content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll find it, but other people do experiments and they say that might not be true under certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just to clarify that, then, if you are just using a regular details and summary, then if you, embed content in there and somebody search is searching for that content, Google can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not only that in the browser will automatically open that, summary area in order to reveal it when you do that search and then ultimately, tap to find it. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; If the search finds it, but also if you&#39;re just on your page and you&#39;re using, what controller f or whatever Yeah, exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It will open up the right tabs. I say that there is a caveat That will be the case by the end of this year. By 2006. It should be, at the moment it&#39;s just working in the chromium browsers, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;re running a bit ahead with that. that was it. There were the only other little thing I looked at that I thought was a SEO consideration &#39;cause it made me think about FAQs and there was a big thing wasn&#39;t there, about using schema markups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yeah, for these things and getting, yeah, I think this is my understanding. I&#39;d love to be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but reading what they say, I think it&#39;s really only something you&#39;d want to do for the sort of bonafide health organizations or government sites where they&#39;ve got frequently asked questions because they&#39;ve really downgraded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you know the user AI to find most of the stuff, and they&#39;re not interested unless you are, a big, legit company with some real, serious, frequently asked questions that are. gonna be, checked. yeah. So I don&#39;t think the whole marking up a schema, but effectively that would be its own thing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would just be, if you were still using schema, you would only be linking it to the IDs of your separate panels anyway,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Okay. Alright, that&#39;s it. So that&#39;s an in conclusion then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I, think as our show is the no script show. our thing is to try and make websites as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where the reason why we&#39;re gathering these sort of snippets is that we can put together some more builds later as easily as possible for anyone can do it. as we&#39;re no good at scripting languages, we wanna avoid js and it just. So there are some situations where we need JavaScript. So if we want something where it&#39;s a toggle, as we said, where we want to open everything up or close it all in one go, we need JavaScript for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think under a circumstance like that and another circumstance where we might want a actual heading to be the trigger for our panel. For the meaning there. Under those circumstances, we need JavaScript, but I actually think I would for those kind of things, I would do something like Josh Komo does on his blog post where I&#39;d create my own little anchor tags that scroll down to the header for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So that&#39;s really useful if it&#39;s essentially you&#39;ve got a whole page kind of accordion there, haven&#39;t you? You, yes. Put something in a sidebar because it just makes it so much easier to get from point A to point B. but that really wouldn&#39;t work as an accordion &#39;cause you&#39;d be just hiding so much content and when you open one up, it would be just like this massive scroll to, to get to the other one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That&#39;s superior in that scenario, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so. I can&#39;t think of a situation. Maybe you can where I think the. Using details and summary to make a, an exclusive, accordion is something I will use where I need to save space in. Yep. Particularly with that Logitech thing. Yep. On the shopping I can say I use that, but for anything else where it needs JavaScript, I actually now think I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;d use a different pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I If you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think hiding content is its primary purpose, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s just taking something which you wish to be discoverable. But you don&#39;t wish for the person necessarily to see, so it&#39;s basically information which not everybody needs. So an FAQ is a great example of that. because if you are, if you, really genuinely don&#39;t need an answer to the 15 questions that you&#39;ve got on, they&#39;re just one of them, that&#39;s the one you wanna hone into, but you wanna be able to just summarize the titles quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it this question? No, click on this one. There&#39;s my answer, and then move on. But the example that you just gave from Josh Yeah. that wouldn&#39;t work. &#39;cause all of that whole page is supposed to be the content. You don&#39;t really wanna hide anything. Yeah, you just wanna navigate to it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And that&#39;s how, what Wikipedia do, they&#39;ve got. Yep. basically anchor tags that take you to where you need to go. And I think that&#39;s a good way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; of doing this. And you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; keep all your headers, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah. And you can deep link from elsewhere, can&#39;t you? Which is quite nice. Yeah. Yeah. just to be, just to help people navigate this, let&#39;s say people are getting to the end of this piece of audio content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s gonna be some associated. Like tutorials if you like. You&#39;re gonna do some run throughs of how you actually build all of this. Where will Thats surf surface on our website. Will it be available in a particular spot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. This one will come up &#39;cause it&#39;s following on from the learn videos I did. So what we&#39;re just gonna go and do now is, it will be available on the no Script show slash learn slash 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Got it. Okay, so they&#39;re not in sync. So 20. So this is the no script show, forward slash 20. It doesn&#39;t map. It&#39;s not go to Learn dash 20. So we&#39;re gonna be no script show Forward slash learn. And then obviously from forward slash Learn you be able to see things. But coincidentally, this one is gonna be forward slash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 at the end as well. Okay. Makes perfect sense. There&#39;s a, there&#39;s some little, there&#39;s some little teaser. Yes. So yeah, that&#39;s a really nice development that we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re doing these audio video pieces of content where you can see us discuss the problem if you like, and then we&#39;re gonna go pause the video and then make some other content, around how to actually build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s quite nice. New development for this whole. Whole enterprise. Are we done for today though? Yeah. So it&#39;s just buy to our audio. Okay. In that case, yeah. See you later. Audio listeners. for the rest of you, we will continue and crack on with our learn. I&#39;ll see you in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
