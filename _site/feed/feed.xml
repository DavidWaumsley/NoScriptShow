&lt;h2 id=&quot;starter-sites&quot;&gt;Starter Sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11ty has something similar to WordPress themes called starter sites. It also has plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some places to look for themes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://11tybundle.dev/starters/&quot;&gt;11ty Bundle&lt;/a&gt;. A fabulous place for all things 11ty by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bobmonsour.com/&quot;&gt;Bob Monsour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstackthemes.dev/#ssg=eleventy&quot;&gt;JamStack Themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/&quot;&gt;The 11ty site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starter sites are typically plain for us to add our own CSS, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CloudCannon/campus-spark-bookshop-template&quot;&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;. Some are created around Tailwind or Bootstrap or include javaScript framework intergration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 considered suited to the show&#39;s website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog&quot;&gt;The 11ty Base Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eventy Excellent by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lenesaile.com/en/&quot;&gt;Lene Saile&lt;/a&gt; was the closest fit as it used CUBE CSS, Paul Irish&#39;s Lite YouTube Embed and has a strew of great features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Bell has a couple of articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bell.bz/i-hooked-up-eleventy-to-wordpress-api/&quot;&gt;hooking 11ty to WordPress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bell.bz/importing-eleventy-content-into-wordpress/&quot;&gt;importing 11ty content to WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These talk about using WordPress plugins to tell hosts to rebuild 11ty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mikeaparicio.com/posts/2023-11-07-using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-for-eleventy/&quot;&gt;Using Wordpress as a headless CMS for Eleventy by Mike Aparicio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://davedavies.dev/post/how-to-use-11ty-with-headless-wordpress/&quot;&gt;How to use 11ty with Headless WordPress and deploy to Netlify by Dave Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The mentioned WordPress plugins have not been updated in 4 years. We also have to consider the number concurrent builds our static hosting plan allow if letting clients update. Netlify only allows one on the free plan.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-alternative&quot;&gt;An alternative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11ty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/migrate/wordpress/#use-@11ty/import&quot;&gt;importer&lt;/a&gt; that can graps WordPress posts from the WordPress REST API. It works out of the box with the 11ty base blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;early-conclusion&quot;&gt;Early conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WP notify plugin could be used as a prompt to devs to do a manual update, but imagine someone repeatedly publishing to correct typos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated updates require WP plugin dependencies and or skills to manage that. For a simple blog setting up Decap&#39;s free CMS seem easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the cost, technical complexity and maintenance overhead of headless along with the growth of static and uncertaintly in WordPress it seem this is likey to be in decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Hello there. This is the second video looking at the 11 static sites generator from the perspective of WordPress users. In the first episode, we built a simple site from scratch, and in this we are looking at 11 starter sites and some of the more advanced features. David has begun rebuilding the show site using the 11ty base blog and can share this experience of it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we&#39;ll also talk a little bit about using 11ty as a static front. End to WordPress. So I mentioned David. There he is. How are you doing, David? You right? Yeah, I&#39;m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; really good. we&#39;ve got a lot to cover with this. We do. I probably, and I&#39;m nervous again because it&#39;s outta my depth with this stuff, and, we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; will forgive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s a bit of live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; stuff going on again. yeah. So should we bring up our show notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, let&#39;s put the bits and pieces on the screen. There we go. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;re actually using here, what we started working on, which you. The place for our, a new site. So it&#39;s on my local host at the moment, so I&#39;m using that for the notes and it&#39;s coming from the base blog, which we&#39;ve mentioned over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve done a, little bit of styling on it, but not much already. I think probably the first thing, just to note for anybody who is coming from WordPress like us is that, Levi to, does have something similar to WordPress themes in that they call these kind of starter sites, and it also has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plugins as well. but it&#39;s different. it hasn&#39;t had 20 years of, arguing over what a theme of a plugin should do, but, yeah. but they&#39;re quite different on that. So let&#39;s quickly talk about where you might be able to get one of these teams. &#39;cause that was the first thing I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll use a starter theme to get us. Go in and effectively I ruled it out and then came back to the idea of using the base blog. So let&#39;s talk about other themes that are around. I wanted to mention this one. I&#39;ll bring this up, which is the 11 bundle, because honestly I wouldn&#39;t have got as far as I have if it wasn&#39;t thanks to, and I&#39;ll bring his site up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Mons, I think, I hope that&#39;s how you say his name. But he does this great job. He&#39;s got great articles. Himself. So he&#39;s definitely somebody to follow if you&#39;re into eleventy. But he does list his own sort of chosen kind of updated list of other things here. And what&#39;s nice about is you can see which version of eleventy it&#39;s using on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also I just wanted to mention &#39;cause it&#39;s got this fire hose here, which has pretty much all the articles that are coming on about 11 and there&#39;s about one a day on these. So definitely worth taking a look at that. And out of interest, actually, the ones that I considered really suitable for our show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if we were using a starter site, were the ones that are first listed here. So 11ty base blog, 11ty Excellence, and Alva here as well. So that was good. Also, another place which I discovered, which doesn&#39;t add much on it, is this. placed JAMstack themes. So you can look at the 11tywo ones. Here we&#39;ve got Astro, which is more popular, not many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s only 19 listed, but Astro, which is very popular at the moment and has 18. So I&#39;m not sure how updated that is. So you get a, screenshot of this and where to go from GitHub to get it and a demo, whether one&#39;s available. And finally the last place, and probably the first place for most people to look would be the levity site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it has the starter projects here, and this has got a nice feature, as you can see over here. It&#39;s. Got, the, oh, it&#39;s like a Google Pay spa scores, right? Yeah. So it&#39;s, they&#39;ve got a wonderful thing on here, the leaderboard, where it&#39;s actually taking the live data of real users using these themes and stuff, so you can actually see who&#39;s doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can put your site on it actually, and have it judged to see how it&#39;s doing. Excellent. Yeah, it&#39;s quite, quite a cool little thing, but there&#39;s something like 90 to a hundred or something of the starter themes, which are available here. One that I was looking at before, I can see this here, but you may notice, that most of them look pretty plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, certainly the little thumbnail there does in many cases look quite plain, but not always. It seems te text heavy, if Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes it is. And I think really if you were someone, come in as a non coder, non coders do certainly use starter sites. They don&#39;t need to know HMO very well or CSS, and they can get started if they stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But generally, I would think. That it&#39;s mostly the audience that attracts the people who are into HML and CSS and will want to build their own. Of course. So you&#39;ll do your own styling on top of this. So I think, Really, I, that&#39;s what I put as note here is that it&#39;s, I would say they&#39;re typically played, so you can add your own CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other thing is, there is an exception here. Let me just, there&#39;s quite a few exceptions, I guess to all of that, as there always is. let me just bring this one up. so you do get, something to contradict that, something which is fully fledged Something Yeah, that looks like a, actually looks like a WordPress site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dare I say it? Yeah, it does. And it&#39;s got all of these kind of cool things on it, but I think that&#39;s the exception to the rule. with these kind of things where they&#39;re heavily styled, they&#39;re usually left to do, whatever you prefer. Some of them though, what might be useful if you are, somebody uses Tailwind or something, some of &#39;em are integrated with that, or Bootstrap or they&#39;re integrated with some of the JavaScript frameworks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as mentioned, there was three, I think. For us, the base blog, which I ended up deciding to use, and 11 Excellence, which, you&#39;ve seen before. &#39;cause I said I love, this. Yes. Yeah. It could have saved us a lot of time, I thought. I don&#39;t know why I love that. I just do. I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it is really well done. Lena Sael, I think is her name is. German developer who lives in Spain and she does a lot of sort of levity stuff and really a very clever woman and a lot of people, as you can see here, have used this site to build their own. She&#39;s listed them out here. These other people, some of &#39;em are her own projects, but other people have used these and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I communicated to her because she was just releasing something new and there was something that came up, which I didn&#39;t understand, and she was quick to get back with me, and there&#39;s a new version of it and why I like this, why I thought this was good for our needs was the fact that, As we know, I&#39;m a big fan of Cube CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also is using that and, talks about many of the things I do. She&#39;s got, dark and light mode in this, which is something that I wanted to add. We&#39;re using YouTube, Embeds. Yeah. Using Paul Iris&#39;s light embeds. So you only load the thumbnail image rather than load all the stuff that&#39;s all baked into all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s some really, she&#39;s got pagination, which isn&#39;t in the base blog, which we&#39;re using at the moment. she&#39;s also got, lemme just show you this &#39;cause I think this is quite full. this graph image is built into this. oh, nice. Where, what it does it, basically what it does is it creates your open graph images for, that you need for it because it prints out on a SVG that you put in, turns it into a jpeg, I think, or a ping image, whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and prints out your data and whatever else you put in there. So you have these automatic created. things which we don&#39;t actually need. No. Yeah. So I think I&#39;m gonna use it for my own personal blog because I think it&#39;s fantastic. But anyway, I just wanted spend, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you decided against it for the no script show option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. And there was one other, I think I&#39;ll just quickly show it that, and again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I just love this. There&#39;s just something about the color. I think it&#39;s the color system of this one that I really like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but it&#39;s so simple. This Yeah, it&#39;s so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; nice. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; again, we got light and dark on this. what was really nice, and I won&#39;t open it up, but it actually integrates with front matter CMS, which I Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showed in the last episode where it&#39;s an extension Yeah. For. vs. Code and it, so you can get a CMS experience if you like, in your VS code thing. So that&#39;s it. But yeah, and it&#39;s got also, multilanguage. Oh, multi. You can set this up for your, yeah. So you can do that. but anyway, we didn&#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go with the base blog just to learn from all I, I did. &#39;cause I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve got a skim over, so we can talk about that a little bit more. We did say that we will talk about using, 11ty as a static front end for WordPress, which is, headless WordPress is the kind of, been a popular thing. Certainly. I won&#39;t go into too much detail here. I have put some articles, it&#39;s a Coupled by Andy Bell, on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it both ways, hooking 11tywo WordPress and importing 11 content into WordPress. So going the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; am I right in saying though that this is like a bit of an endeavor that&#39;s run out of steam a bit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I, don&#39;t think so. I. there is, let me just bring this all on this by Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aio, I must say that, right? Yeah, we&#39;ll go&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; with that. Cio. I&#39;m gonna say ar reio. Yeah, geo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I dunno. Yeah, I&#39;ve watched some videos. He does, he has some really great content on, design systems and, he&#39;s got a great article here as another one on this where you can set this up using this kind of fetch, node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that which will fetch all the posts from WordPress and then you bring that into 11 and to make this all work as the client that I had in this particular case that he&#39;s talking about, they wanted that for pages and posts and he brought it in and connected it up and all the code is here. The thing is with both of these articles, and I dunno if it&#39;s down here, where it shows you I won&#39;t find it quickly, is both of &#39;em are using two different WordPress plugins so that when the client updates and publishes, that sends a communication to the hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of &#39;em is actually just for netlify to say rebuild. 11. So it would update the post there. The snag that I found with these is that these articles, I mean they&#39;re later than when these plugins came in, but the two plugins that are mentioned by Dave Davis, who&#39;s got a very similar, post on this, I looked them up and they&#39;ve both not been updated for four years and one of them has actually closed any contributions to their GitHub repository, right? so I think this is not for somebody like you and I who haven&#39;t got these skills to be able to make sure that this, these people have maybe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; moved on and maybe they just built it for a particular project that they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they had to just migrate a massive site or something like that, and this was just the most effective way to do it. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, but you could do it and if you&#39;ve got the skills, but I thought it was beyond us. But there is a nice little alternative I think, which will just allow, and I&#39;ll, do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a video by Zach Leatherman, the author of Eleventy who shows this. But I&#39;ll, repeat it again just because it, Allow me to show how you might import a starter site Okay. From scratch as well. So we&#39;ve got the 11ty importer where you can bring in, it&#39;ll grab the WordPress posts from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ll see if this works with this. so what I need to do first, let me get rid of some of this. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; get your, palette clean. Yeah. Is helpful set up. So what, just to be clear, you are gonna use this importer tool. The link is in the no script show, notes, and the endeavor is to import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posts, I guess pages as well. How does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. posts on this one is what it set up for you. Okay. The 11 importer, which I, just quickly brought up, actually I&#39;ve got a link to it here. Yeah. Actually does other stuff here. So there is a nice little video that is done on this one and I dunno if we can find it quickly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will do WordPress &#39;cause that&#39;s the most popular thing. It will also bring in things from YouTube, but it will also bring in things from. there&#39;s more migration here. There&#39;s another platform. What&#39;s the popular platform? that&#39;s an alternative to Twitter. Masteron. Oh, Masteron, okay. So it can import stuff on that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. That&#39;s interesting. Yeah. So let&#39;s see if we can go back here. And now what I need to do is when you go to any of these starter sites, so if I was to go to. The base blog here, what we&#39;ll find is that you can just use this template and generally what you might want to do is to, then create a new repository for yourself on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already got that. So if I just go and click on me, go to my repositories. I&#39;ve already brought this in and I&#39;ve got base blog over here. Okay. Got it. Yep. So if I go into that and then, and I mentioned it last time we were talking, that it might be useful to have GitHub desktop. Yes, you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Like that. Yeah. So if we open that up, then what I can do is take this repository, which I&#39;ve copied and hopefully. Oh, there we are. We&#39;ve come in. So it&#39;s let&#39;s just check that it&#39;s going to where I want it to go. So it&#39;s coming from where I want and it&#39;s going to local path 10th. That&#39;s exactly where I want it to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice. There is a code. Yeah, there is. Whoa. Okay. And that&#39;s done actually. And I&#39;m gonna open it up in visual. I&#39;ve got two of these open now, so we could have problems. It&#39;s all No problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we&#39;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; work with you. We&#39;ll figure it out. I&#39;ll do away with that. And I should bring this up on this screen &#39;cause you can&#39;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I should just also increase the size &#39;cause you can&#39;t see much, can you? Is that Yeah, that&#39;s fine. We,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, we&#39;ve got lots now We can definitely read that. That&#39;s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we may, what we&#39;ll need to do first probably go to the read be document because what we&#39;ve already made. A clone of this one, and we&#39;ve already set that up, but actually, because it hasn&#39;t included all the node stuff there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. We&#39;re gonna have to install all of that ourselves here. So bear with while I just bring up the terminal. Terminal and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;re gonna NPM install? Oh no, I&#39;m not gonna do that. Not that one. Oh, this is your short code. Sorry. This is your text expander that you&#39;re using to generate the. Yes it is correct code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you maybe just copy and paste In this case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s quite short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; There we are. There you go. And now we&#39;ve got&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; small bit of time. Actually this will allow me, one is just doing that &#39;cause it&#39;s got, loading all the notes. I just wanted to mention something. Let me just bring this up. If you are using some of the starter sites, what might scare somebody new is seeing something like this, which is what I saw, on Elva before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I also saw it on the 11 is. oh gosh. Yeah. That looks terrifying. Yeah, It&#39;s because it&#39;s a node which is no longer supported. And what you can, it gives you the information. You can just run the NPN Audit fix and it will sort things out, and it&#39;s probably okay, and the author will do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just thought it was worth throwing in that. If you&#39;re coming to this for the first time as I was, something like this is quite a scary thing to see if this is not we&#39;re used to doing press on regardless. Okay. Yes. Okay. So you do get something there. Anyway, we should have copied all of our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it says it still watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more time to kill here, David. What else can we, no,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s done. It&#39;s, the wrong one. I&#39;ve got it open twice, so I see that and now we can run the 11tyail and I&#39;ll do that with my, short. Key and we should have that now. There we go. Yeah. Or 80. 80. 80. There&#39;re So I increase, there we go. I increase the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now what we can do here just to show so that&#39;s basically installed in it, and then you can work from there. So it&#39;s not. Too bigger job to start from the starter site, get it on your local level. Now, once you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; know what you&#39;re doing there, which you clearly now do, I think that was a two minute enterprise for you o of without all the talking and everything that you had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s probably a couple of minutes, isn&#39;t it? Yeah, exactly. Coffee and come back and it&#39;s all good to go. So this is the, which starter site is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this? What&#39;s, this is the base blog. Except the only thing is I&#39;ve increased the font size on. Now what I wanted to do was just show the importer working. &#39;cause that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s quite cool. Yep. so if I just get rid of this again, and we&#39;ll go back here and I&#39;ve got the, what I need to put in already typed out because. Oh, you&#39;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You&#39;re a good YouTuber, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you&#39;ve got yourself ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So what I&#39;ve just pasted in here, this is all we need is something telling that we&#39;re going to import WordPress to this particular address that we&#39;ve got in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we want to do is to output this content. Sorry, output it into the content and into the blog section. So one thing that we do need to know if we&#39;re using one of the starter themes is where we want that stuff to go. And in this case, with the base blog, it&#39;s in content, and then our posts go in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay? So we want that to be the same. And then we, could do a drive run. We can decide where we want to locate the assets, but in this case, the assets want to, set to co-locate. So effectively what this should do. It should put them in a folder with the post themselves. Okay. So the images that go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me just run this and let&#39;s just see if it works. and we should, oh, it&#39;s asking me now because I. I haven&#39;t got the import package in there, so I&#39;m just going to say yes. Okay. I want that and it&#39;s going to do that as well. The beauty, you probably only needed. Yes, it&#39;s because I&#39;ve opened up a new one and what we&#39;re seeing here is it&#39;s fetching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s fetching the different JSON files, so this is using the WordPress rest, REST API to drag in these posts. And I know there&#39;s one error on this and what we should see over here is. In our blog. Okay. Now we have our posts and we should see that with these, they put the assets co-located them with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the co-locate thing. Okay, got it. Yes. And if I can find the right tab. I will,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just show you now. Just, there we go. I was just gonna say, we&#39;re looking at a very pink screen there, but we&#39;re, back. We, can now see your brow. That great. We should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; back, let&#39;s see if I&#39;m on the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It was definitely 80 82, port 80 82. So why is there some caching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; going on? Probably. This is the problem when you&#39;re doing this. Browser caching is always, what I&#39;ll do off screen. You can&#39;t see this. I shall just run this again. I. When you say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; run this again, are you gonna, I&#39;m just restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m 11. Let&#39;s just see if that shakes it up. There we are. We&#39;ve got our post. Yeah. so we&#39;ve got, yeah. So all been well, yeah, it&#39;s brought in the assets. Now. Something to just notice. there are a few little things that you get, so if you&#39;ve got, as I have in this case, it was built with a page builder and I&#39;m using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A form of that kind of, all of these had a video on the top there, which was hidden behind this kind of code that I put. So it didn&#39;t manage to pick up on that, but otherwise the images and everything, so Set that up. That would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so you did something quirky in WordPress, which 11? The importer there, it just was on, it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; was unable to, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Is unable to understand what all the, what complexities were going on there. Otherwise it would, picking the JavaScript that was needed, but it was done in such a convoluted way, so it was missing on that. it does this, I read somebody said they had an 8,000 article blog and it took 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the importer, two minutes to, to bring all of that data over. So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; To to, the human mind. 8,000 sounds like a lot, but to a machine just pausing text, it&#39;s just yeah, bring it on. That&#39;s fine. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. That bit&#39;s done. I&#39;m going to get rid of this. okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; that was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a, really nice example of how to do it. So you&#39;ve, managed to import in a matter of moments, an entire WordPress site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Oh, the other thing that you might just be interested in, if I go to the site that was, this is the first thing I thought, is the rest API. So if I actually go to the site, it was important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s actually blocked off. I&#39;ve got a maintenance mode on it. I&#39;ve got everything set, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it&#39;s invisible to the human reader. But the rest API just. Very, yeah, exactly. You through all of that. Okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; great. so if I just gave a, client a log into this, it would be fine. And if, because of course it&#39;s taking the post data, it&#39;s turning that into markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So if you had a lot of junk code, which I did on that, it cleans it up. Really. It just takes the Oh, that&#39;s nice too. That&#39;s a unexpected benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Excellent. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So my, got a lot cleaner. Good for moving that over. okay, let&#39;s go back to our notes, our article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Where are we now then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think so. We&#39;ve done the importer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; We have, we&#39;ve done how to, download us, start a site and get started with that. I think, we were talking about this earlier, I think we share the same conclusion that maybe because of the technical complexities and maintenance with headless and the growth of, static CMS is going around, I think it&#39;s probably not something you&#39;ll either go one way or the other, won&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think with it, I think. There&#39;ll be less headless solutions. Yeah, it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; feels like 5, 3, 4, 5 years ago, headless was a real buzzword. It was really an interesting thing. I imagine probably an enterprise, it still might be. Yeah. But it doesn&#39;t feel like, your normal freelancer working in the, let&#39;s say WordPress space is gonna be too interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause there&#39;s just so many moving parts that could go wrong. And I&#39;m not sure that the, benefits outweigh the. The hassle unless you really are truly an expert and this is all absolute muscle memory. And, I&#39;ve not really heard anybody talking about headless much in the WordPress space of late. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe it&#39;s run its course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I never got it at the time because I just thought, I don&#39;t, I&#39;ve not had security issues &#39;cause I look after. Okay. And caching gives me a face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Caching is the sort of the golden bullet there, isn&#39;t it? A little bit, yeah. Okay. Yeah, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Should we talk about what we&#39;ve been doing here as we are using this local version where we&#39;re trying to recreate using the 11 blog and the reason why, when you say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; what we&#39;re doing here, do you mean what we&#39;re looking at on the screen? This, Yes. Yeah. Okay, great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry. So style wise, we&#39;re not there that, we haven&#39;t put the logos in here, but we have taken the Eleventy Bog, which is, and I&#39;ve added in the things that, Might have taken me to another theme to this and taken away some things as well from it. And I did it really because I thought I wanted to know how complex it would be for someone like me, to take a starter site. Would it be the same problem you can have in WordPress where I&#39;ve done it, where you want to reconfigure some parts of a theme that you&#39;ve already got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Yep. And there&#39;s just too much to wade through and there&#39;s an element of that as well. But I found it very useful because I&#39;ve been able to learn by, because the base bog is the one that. Zach Leatherman looks after and created. So probably the best person to learn from if you&#39;re gonna get into starter sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was perfect to a certain degree for what we needed. the only thing we didn&#39;t have is I wanted the light and dark. Okay. on this. And we also needed, which I was mentioning before, if I go back to, let&#39;s just go into the archive here and go into our last. thing we wanted to have this thing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t click on it now, but it&#39;s just loading the image. It looks like it&#39;s the video. It&#39;s not loading the stuff right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; There&#39;s some wizardry going on where it will load the video when you click on that image, that thing that looks like a video. Okay. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So we&#39;re using Paul Iris&#39;s light in bed, which will just serve up and hold back YouTube from all of its JavaScript and just serve up the image for quick thing that interestingly enough, there is anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web component that Zach Lettermans built, which is based on the same thing. But I haven&#39;t used that. I&#39;ve just put it in &#39;cause I know how to do that myself. Okay. and did that, what else did I need to add in here? There was one other thing that doesn&#39;t come with the 11 base blog, which we needed really, I think, and I can just demonstrate it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Is the pagination on the archive pages? Get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So what does it do? Does it just try to load everything all in one go if there&#39;s no pagination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So on the original blog that you get, it just, it&#39;s just the text that it gives you to start with it. Yeah, it&#39;s a starter site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it can almost go and on endlessly then, because it, browsers will be able to cope with all of that kind of information. But if you want to section it out like this, seem nice to add this in. So that was quite, an adventure for me. AI helped me though. Interesting. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it wasn&#39;t straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&#39;t like a, I don&#39;t know, something built into the base blog that you can just declare something. You had to go out and find the way to build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, there is, PA pagination is something that you can easily add with 11ty. Okay. The way that I needed to add it in this particular case with the base blog, which I&#39;ll maybe touch on in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, yeah, sure, sure. Maybe a bit more complex. But the beauty is, and this is a real tip if anyone wants to do this, what discovered is that ai certainly clawed and I was trying deep seek at the time, so I was asking them both questions where I got stuck with the base bog and it go. it struggled as well, but when I said I&#39;m using the base bug, it goes, ah, this is what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s configured this way. Interesting. Okay. So shows the documentation&#39;s really good for the 11th stuff &#39;cause it was able to Okay. Yeah, Tell you exactly what it did. yeah, so it, it sorted me out. So that&#39;s just the basic stuff that I made some changes. Obviously we need some styling, we sorted this sort of stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, shall I bring up, I think I&#39;ll bring up the code editor for this. If I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it was fairly straightforward for me as a, as somebody watching what you were doing to figure out what you&#39;ve done. But I imagine it was a bit of a bed of worms to, actually do it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we got a whole bunch of, I. So the, one of the things I think, with a starter site like this for me was the fact that the downside of it all is the fact that you really do need to understand how things have been configured in, something like this. Because there&#39;s a lot of great sort of things that been set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them I&#39;ve commented out, which is the images, I won&#39;t go into this, but it has a wonderful image plugin where if you upload into an image, it will, you can. If you can set it to do almost anything, but it will, it will turn, if it&#39;s a heavy SVG, it will turn it into, whatever the smallest thing is an A VI or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay? It will add in the sizes. It will create a picture tag if it needs to serve a viv, and then a backup of a web p or a backup of a jpeg, right? For those browsers that don&#39;t support it, it will do this all automatically. I pulled it out only because of the build time with it, because this would be perfect if you are a CMS person and you&#39;ve got a client coming in and dragging in any kind of image, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take care of all of that trouble for you, but that&#39;s not us and we&#39;re not using many images. In fact, we&#39;re using what comes from YouTube, our thumbnail. So you just did it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; expediency. Given your situation where not many images and the ones that you are using, you&#39;ve probably got the right format and optimize them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly. So I thought, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. So I mean I, I ran a test on it earlier. There&#39;s one other, the things that we put in as a little diagram, and you know it on the defaults, it just set me with a different versions in a picture tag. And the smallest was the Avis. That&#39;s something like nine kilobytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I just thought, our audience. If I needed that again, I would just put it in without the picture tag as a na, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It wouldn&#39;t need different sizes. It&#39;s so small. Anyway, so I thought that&#39;s generally the way we go. So I took that out. Okay. But there are some really cool things and, let me mention first where I got stuck, and AI helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I go into the contents, are we still on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the, are we still on pagination? We&#39;re still. On&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that I was gonna talk about pagination. Yes, exactly. Yeah. it didn&#39;t, it had it on the post. So you&#39;ve got the next post and the before post, that&#39;s automatically in the base blog. But I didn&#39;t have it on the archive pages and I created my own additional pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the example of chat here, what you discover is it uses another plugin called the 11 navigation, which allows you to really construct some, if you wanted to. A mega menu or something like this, okay? Allow you to organize things a lot better. &#39;cause you can put &#39;em in the subcategories, but because it does that, and this is something I think I mentioned, gray, gray matter as something that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t gray matter. This is a, an 11tyhing where you can use JavaScript in your front matter area. On this. So suddenly everything I&#39;m doing in my template now, because I&#39;ve got the navigation now has to be turned into something which is in a JavaScript format. If you&#39;ll, gosh, okay. Yeah. Which is where it goes beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But luckily I was able to add the pagination simply by asking one of the ais, I&#39;m using the base blog. I want to do this. And, it just churned this out for me, which is using the standard code, which you&#39;ll see anyway in the documentation, but it just put it in the right syntax or format for the matter area here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&#39;s just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; looking at that and not knowing what I&#39;m talking about, it looks like it&#39;s going so reverse. True is newest to oldest, I&#39;m guessing. Yeah, the alias is almost like a custom post out. We&#39;re looking for the posts. The size six is how many to show before the, before you need to click the pagination, so there&#39;s six on a page, and then there&#39;ll be six more on a page and six more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And exactly. Data collections podcast. I don&#39;t even know what that is. Not a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that&#39;s because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve named this particular collection, so it&#39;s on the, got it. Page, which we&#39;ve now called chat at the moment where, okay, some, this is why it&#39;s not up at all because we, still sort out some of the naming conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We called it podcast and maybe we&#39;ll call it chats. I&#39;ll reconfigure this. But the beauty of it is, and it&#39;s the same with the tagging system of the base blog, is that it&#39;s automated for you. So when I need a new page, this is automatically going, yeah. It&#39;s not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gonna figure it all out for you. Okay. And it&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; going to, because of 11, it&#39;s going to put the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big previous and the next and everything can create that, then we can change what we call that, over here. So, we&#39;ve got that all built in. and it&#39;s the same with the tagging system as well. This is built into the base bog. If I create a new tag on one of my posts, it&#39;s gonna do it, but that was just one of the little gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I got into with that. That&#39;s, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; in some respects I&#39;m surprised that isn&#39;t built into the base of 11. But then again, you might not want, some sort of archive of anything. You might just want a five page website with just, the navigation in the top right of the desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it makes sense not to have it in, if you&#39;re trying to keep things lean. Makes sense. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I, think maybe, it&#39;s, pagination does seem like something for the base blog because it is designing for blogs, but also we&#39;ve gone down a different route slightly with this in the sense that you would generally have a blog and then you would have tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve used the tag. Oh, I see. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Got it. Yeah. Yeah, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; still if, I go back into any of these. it doesn&#39;t matter. which one, you&#39;ll see I&#39;ve got a tagging system, but it&#39;s also running into the tags. It&#39;s automatically creating. So any new tags that I put in my front matter will get a new tag separate to the ones that I&#39;ve created for ourselves and looped here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it. If that makes sense. yeah, that does make sense. Okay. So it&#39;s a, it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; is a different taxonomy structure than, what I&#39;m used to in WordPress, which obviously just handles all this out the box. There&#39;s, other ways of doing things in, eleventy with tagging. Okay. All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. it&#39;s pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s just go into the blog. One nice thing is that it&#39;s set up so contents of the area, so anything in there can get changed and all the posts are in here and I didn&#39;t know I could do this, but it&#39;s set up. Two, recognize anything in here so I could put a folder in without messing things up and organize our posts over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, a nice thing to do. And if I go over to, let&#39;s just go into the one we&#39;re looking at the moment we&#39;ll do, This is what I&#39;m doing now is I&#39;m able to, it&#39;s something I didn&#39;t mention last time round, so I put a little note, because when I was, if you met, I was creating a simple site and just to give you an introduction to the idea of collections and how you might create posts, I didn&#39;t explain the fact that my post names didn&#39;t match what my URL was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. So we could,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:03] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this is how you do it basically. So it&#39;ll sify. Nice five. Yeah. So I&#39;m telling it to go into the permalink. Of build and this, and I&#39;ll just add to it. I&#39;ve created a tag here. I could create many more and it will automatically create those tags for me. So if we decide that there&#39;s some crossover between the things that we&#39;re doing in our categories, or this other ones, I can put them in and they will just tag and create the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, pages we need. And the beauty is with the video id, that&#39;s how I&#39;ve connected it up with the Paul Iris&#39;s light YouTube embed and bringing forward those images. I&#39;ve now been able to put that so it goes in the metadata. So if as an open graph image, it could be used on the front page to automatically do it, and it&#39;s outputting as well to the individual posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So nice. Got it right. Yeah. Yeah. And there&#39;s another nice thing as well in there that you can do drafts as well. So if you put this as, I&#39;ve commented it out the moment, but if I set this to draft true. I can still, I can still, do a build to the hosting work on this. It&#39;s not gonna show it until I either remove this or set it to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. So it&#39;s, not going to, yeah. So it&#39;s gonna ignore it. So you can work on that useful, a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; pending status, but there it is, ready to roll. You just delete that draft. Yeah. I&#39;ll just delete that out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and then the next time I do an update to got it. As I would do to, it&#39;s going to do that. That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s, let me go back to the notes. Actually, I need to come back here. Okay. What, didn&#39;t we cover? Any questions that you&#39;ve got so far? No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; all of it seems, straightforward isn&#39;t the word &#39;cause it&#39;s all very new to me and I would probably upend me if I tried to do it myself. But no, that all makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; there is, the syntax highlighting is quite a nice thing that we wanted to put in, which came in there. If I just go into one of the learns over here and go into. Light and dark toggle here. It&#39;s got this wonderful way of, it&#39;s, used in somebody else&#39;s library, another 11 user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; this what we are looking at there, the code example that you&#39;re looking at. If you would just type that in as marked down, it would just look like. Any old text, you&#39;ve what? There&#39;s a sort of plugin if you like, and that enables you to encapsulate that portion as, show me this as code instead, and then it&#39;ll, with a bit of CSS, it&#39;ll put it in a darker box and it will make the, it will format CSS so that the bits and pieces which you want to be in different colors, are in different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. And in fact, let me just go over here. If I go to one of the learn examples and let&#39;s make sure I&#39;ve got one with a bit of code in it. I&#39;m sure there is somewhere, I&#39;ll probably pick the one. There&#39;s a bit of HML there by the looks of it. There&#39;s a bit of H ml, so we have these three back ticks and then you put the language that you want it to do that with and Put this in. So it&#39;s gonna be there. And that&#39;s the format with this. We&#39;ve got some CSS here. Got it. Feedback ticks. We close &#39;em with BT ticks as well. And then we just put CSS and then it&#39;s gonna display that and what&#39;s happening behind the scenes, which allows me just to talk about snake else. I&#39;m going off tangents, but, the CSS, so last time we did a video, we talked about the CSS and I bundled it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a Nun Jux file and included all of the different CSS style sheets that had into that one. Now I tried to do something similar, but I got into a mess and I just decided to use what&#39;s already set up in the 11 base blog, which I think is pretty cool. If I just go into, let me just open the this up. On the, let&#39;s go into our Includes, into our layout and into the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. It does it all in the template here, and you have this kind of, there&#39;s lots of stuff and I&#39;ll probably have to stop &#39;cause it&#39;ll get. Too boring soon, but, there&#39;s a lot of stuff that goes on in here. So there&#39;s another bit of a sort of plugin if you like, which allows you to get a bundle by the URL here, and you can specify at CSS and then you can put this in here, what you want to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s gonna send it all to one location, which is set up into another folder called the distribution, the dis. Folder and it puts it all together in that way, which is a slightly different way. But the nice thing about this is that you can also, if you wanted to have that as inline CSS on your page, you can just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; have Oh, print out within the star sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And so it also means as is used as well on the base blog. Naturally it is actually printed in line. I&#39;ve changed this now, so it puts it in a style sheet, but it does allow you say the syntax highlighting which we were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Is one of the things that&#39;s, brought in. And in fact, then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re just putting that on the post. I think it might be showing here that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So the, if, there&#39;s no, so for example, on a post, there&#39;s a high probability that you want c syntax highlighting for C-S-S-H-T-M-L, et cetera. and if you&#39;re doing it, if you&#39;re injecting that in line only when it&#39;s needed in this case, in a post, because there&#39;s a high opportunity that a post will have that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you could do it on a. Page by page basis, or a post by post basis. And yet the CSS file is stored in the same place in that little bundle. that&#39;s quite clever actually. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. it&#39;s putting the distribution and then, so in this case it&#39;s been automatically set up In fact, it&#39;s pulling in that theme is what&#39;s given me the, coloring for the syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and actually there&#39;s another one in there which I&#39;ve left as it is there, which just is the difference, the changes made to the original, but it&#39;s actually can pull these things in from the node modules themselves, rather than what you&#39;ve got there. quite cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, let me, yeah, I was just gonna say, do you wanna just quickly knit back to your show notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;cause there was a few things on that page. yeah, it was the one before. And then scroll down. What have we looked at? Were, no, where&#39;s it going? Yeah, so we, you&#39;ve mentioned syntax just now, so I&#39;m looking underneath the pros. The first bullet point there, pre-configure 11 plugins. So the base theme Comes with. Something to do with RSS. You mentioned image transformation. So you can throw a, an image in like an SVG and it will turn it into an A VI and you can configure all of that navigation enables you to do more complicated navigation syntax we&#39;ve just seen. Yeah. Highlighting Id attribute an HTML base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, they&#39;re part of it. I dunno what they are, but Do you want to touch those or is it, you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; see it here, although I might take it away. What it&#39;s doing is when it&#39;s seeing, because it&#39;s a good thing for accessibility. Yeah. Be able to link to headers. What this is doing automatically with the ID attribute, it&#39;s a kind of, is it a plugin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure quite sure, but it&#39;s included and I can remove it with one line. But basically where we see this, if we go into the source code, it&#39;s giving us an ID against this header as well. So if I look there, we&#39;ve got the, it gives me an ID as well. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay, so we&#39;ve got some, so instead of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just being an H three, it&#39;s H three, whatever an idea of whatever the H three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is, so in this case the comms? Yeah. Oh, that&#39;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So on. I guess the only issue you might have is if you have the same title on the sec, but you shouldn&#39;t really ever have that should you? No. on the same page. That&#39;s the only problem with an ID there. Okay. But yeah, it&#39;s quite a nice thing, a little accessibility thing or way to be able to link to a part of your article if you are linking someone else to it built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t have to do anything. It&#39;s automated. There was a actually, and I needed to use this a lot and it&#39;s even for building a simple site first time round, I didn&#39;t really touch on the conditionals else if all the time. Okay. And that&#39;s a really easy thing to do with the nun ju. And I just have to now quickly think on my feet where there&#39;s an example of where I&#39;ve done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve done it in the base blog where I wanted to, in the base nex. Let me just have a look here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So is this like an inline thing we&#39;re looking for? Are we looking for some line? Yes. I want conditional logic of if this the can&#39;t see anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. No you can&#39;t. Can you? &#39;cause I&#39;ve forgotten where I might have put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just have a look. Keep looking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; on. We&#39;re fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#39;t know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the, the way it&#39;ll look, but I&#39;m keen something. Hopefully. Okay. Oh, there was an end if there, right at the bottom. What was that end? If that was one of them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Let&#39;s have a look. Where are we starting with? You had an end, you had an if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much further up. Oh, no, If collections post. Ah yes. So I think it&#39;s not the one I wanted to further down near the bottom of the screen, right near the bottom is an if collections posts, and then obviously there&#39;s an end. If so, you&#39;ve got an, you&#39;ve got an if within an if here by the look. Oh, no, you don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve just got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ve got to on this one. because you&#39;ve got, now I can&#39;t remember what I&#39;ve done, but, anyway, with all I wanted to, I, before I get stuck on what I&#39;ve done here, I think there is my example, this is a perfect example. what I wanted to, when I didn&#39;t have, as you could see actually on the, that we&#39;re looking at, I don&#39;t have a video ID for the thumbnail for the YouTube video &#39;cause it hasn&#39;t gone up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I&#39;ve done is to say. Only if my front matter gives me an id. Will you print out what you need to blank. Oh, and I noticed that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; was in the, that was in the front matter, that portion of text. at the top of the post you had a, I think it said YouTube ID or something and there was like the 10 characters of the slug Of the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Of the YouTube was, it was. It was commented out as well. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s not, because otherwise it would take up the space of YouTube. Lemme me understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; this then if, that wasn&#39;t commented out and it was, so if you&#39;d got a YouTube ID in the post Yes. And it wasn&#39;t commented out, so it did exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That if would say, does it exist? Yes. Okay. Now append it to the end of the YouTube URL and display it. So not only is it doing the job of whether or not to display, but it&#39;s also using the same, yeah, there it is. Video id, it&#39;s using that to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, declare whether&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; it should display or not, but also appending it to the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So if I leave this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and I leave it below course, and if I take this off so it&#39;s there. we needed a conditional to show &#39;cause what&#39;s gonna happen now if I refresh or be, it&#39;s not, is it? Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you need, yeah. You might need to clear some caches or rebuild the whole thing. The vague, I think I just need to rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. But I trust you. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise without that conditional, it would be showing, it would be trying to show, the, in fact, actually, I&#39;ve hidden the head of one and I use the image to replace it. So generally that&#39;s the case. I get it though. That&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; made sense. the syntax of it and all is new to me and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, see what it&#39;s doing. That&#39;s good. Yeah. It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; was worth mentioning that you could do, &#39;cause it was, you&#39;d want that on simple things. And also something I didn&#39;t mention as well last time was the fact that there is these web components. So in Eleventy and I, skipped over it. There is something called Web C, which is Zack Leatherman&#39;s own language for using, web components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact, it&#39;s a web component which is creating, it puts around the main tag, which is creating these IDs combined with. The other Java script that it has there. So that&#39;s another part of 11tywo, which I really haven&#39;t got into. Okay. But it&#39;s another option for how you might put together your sites with, using web components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:47:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; What I&#39;m learning though, is depending on, so unlike, so Okay. The intention of WordPress was never really to put functionality in the theme, but that kind of did end up happening. Yeah. But in the theme, usually in the customizer, you can switch things on or off. Like I show the. I don&#39;t know, the author, show the, metadata for when it was published and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what I&#39;m seeing is something akin to that. Here you&#39;ve got these plugins built inside of a theme, in this case, the base theme that you can switch on, switch off, configure how you like, but obviously it&#39;s much more like hands into the code and figuring all that out. But they enable you to add components to your website, your pages, your posts, add if statements around them, so they show or don&#39;t show depending on certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so you&#39;ve got this framework for building. Based upon the exact same data, you can have a different array of things happening on the pages with these plugins. okay. I&#39;m, beginning to get it a bit, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s, most of the time, it&#39;s the, that&#39;s the downside of with the starter thing because when you start to remove things, you really need to know how the directories are being set up or what plugins, but I&#39;m probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entirely there, but I think I&#39;ve now learned what&#39;s there. you&#39;re calling in, as you see, these are kind of plugins are called in at the top here, import these kind of plugins. Oh, there&#39;s the RSS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; one and navigation. Yeah, Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and yeah, it&#39;s wonderful. And then filters have got some other things that&#39;re all built into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is a bit of doing this, but I was surprised how far I&#39;ve got and how confident I feel. And it&#39;s a little bit, saying about that. There&#39;s a couple of points where I&#39;m really excited. I got excited about WordPress at the time. One of them was when I first started doing my own themes, and that feels a lot like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the other time was when CSS got really difficult and I&#39;ve discovered page builders. So I&#39;ve got like this kind of, it feels like going back to some old days where I, yeah, made powerful, helped a little bit with ai, but, it does mean we. No JavaScript skills. I&#39;ve been able to do some quite complex stuff already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Nice conditions. Yeah. So it&#39;s not, I enjoyed it. How, are we doing with the show notes there? Have we got through what you wanted to say? I think so. Like we had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; maybe, yeah, I think so. There was a couple of things I just wanted to cover. I think I thanked who I wanted. There&#39;s more to show you, on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#39;ll just do a short video if there&#39;s something that&#39;s missed out on this. Okay. That I think might be useful. But, otherwise I think we&#39;ve. Probably, we&#39;ve done our best to try and cover what,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, that, that looks good. So the, endeavor there was to show what a, theme can do, in this case, the base theme inside of 11ty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were loads of options, dozens and dozens of options. Some more minimal looks like, some less minimal. and David showed you where you can get those. As with everything, the, the bits and pieces, the links that you just saw. Will be available for your dilatation, over on the no script show, 1111 based website at some point in the year 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But there&#39;ll be a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; link to wherever you can get the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; notes in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube. Yeah. Comments? Okay. Oh yeah, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, Thank you. so look in the, description of the YouTube video and go from there. Basically. Yeah. Okay. Is that it? Are we wrapping that up? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was useful. Yeah, it was really interesting. Honestly, the more you talk about it, the more convinced I&#39;m that I should give it a go if only I had 50 hours available to meet. Yeah, exactly. It does take some time. Yeah. All right. I&#39;ll see you next time, David. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, bye-bye. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Long-term WordPress user tries building with 11ty (a Static Site Generator)</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/build/6/" />
    <updated>2025-01-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/build/6/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-notes&quot;&gt;Show notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress user we know how to build dynamic sites. We know next to nothing about Static Site Generators and the Jamstack. Here we rebuild a HTML site with 11ty (Eleventy). We also look at adding a CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-we-cover&quot;&gt;Things we cover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we need to run 11ty (Node, Git and free hosting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting 11ty from scratch (installing 11ty).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating our first page. Converting Markdown to HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a header and footer template for our site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing Front Matter (like WordPress custom fields).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding CSS and bundling with a Nunjucks template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bringing in other website assets with the Eleventy config file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the site&#39;s head dynamic for SEO (doing the job of a WordPress SEO plugin).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making HTML more manageable with partials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting CSS classes with Front Matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing data (like WordPress&#39;s database), but with a dynamic menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding events. Similar to working with WordPress&#39;s post loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a CMS (Decap and locally the Front Matter CMS extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@EleventyVideo/videos&quot;&gt;11ty YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://11tybundle.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty Bundle&lt;/a&gt;. A fabulous place for all the latest by Bob Monsour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are years out of date, but with the help of 11ty docs and Claude AI I could covert to 11ty V3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Static vs dynamic for content heavy websites</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/15/" />

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about what to use for the show&#39;s website as the content grows. We&#39;re going to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt; partly because Nathan&#39;s show &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/15/wpbuilds.com/&quot;&gt;WP Builds&lt;/a&gt; is already about WordPress, but also 11ty might be a more logical fit for this particular show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-our-site-needs&quot;&gt;What our site needs:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quicker way to write posts. A text editor or Markdown?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier way to add SEO metadata, open graph, sitemaps and RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to automate tags and categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quicker way to add performant YouTube videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma-of-static-v-dynamic&quot;&gt;The dilemma of Static v Dynamic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old debate. Dynamic provided what we needed in the early 2000&#39;s, but even by 2008 there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a SSG (that inspired 11ty). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404&quot;&gt;Bake don&#39;t fry&lt;/a&gt; by Aaron Swartz in 2002 also got some questioning dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious choice as most successful blogging platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick and easy to set up with no developer skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive range of themes and plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well funded… although topical at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;downsides-for-this-shows-site&quot;&gt;Downsides for this show&#39;s site:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of the code output. Important to a show focussed on web standards and accessibility *.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using WP would not teach us about alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying for hosting(caching/backup/security) and time on software update and maintenance **.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not so easy offer a CMS version of our site demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intented audience. WP is seen as a no code solution. This show is about how lovely and friendly code can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* A classic theme would allow this, but control over the modern block themes requires JS skills we don&#39;t have or need.&lt;br&gt;
** We could convert WP to static for free hosting but manually that is a faff. Services that convert WP to static hosting are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;static-site-generators&quot;&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining popularity at the moment. The 2024 Web Almanac &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-rise-of-static-first-websites-why-major-brands-are-making-the-switch/&quot;&gt;shows 67% growth in static and hybrid website architectures among the top 10,000 most-visited sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-problems-with-static-site-generators-ssg-s&quot;&gt;General problems with Static Site Generators (SSG&#39;s)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs some skills or willingness to use a terminal rather than a UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many choices. No industry standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many have retired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots to set up with a blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s cobbled together out of various bits of tech. House of cards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to add the CMS yourself for a multi author blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No inbuilt commenting system or search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-11ty&quot;&gt;Why 11ty?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s 360 SSG&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstack.org/generators/&quot;&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly the simplest way to explore SSGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unopinionated. There&#39;s no way to know you have used it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible with a range of templating languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You add complexity as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast build times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not VC funded *.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users include: W3C, UK gov, US gov, Google, Cern, NASA, A11Y Project, Web.dev and CSS Tricks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello and welcome to the No Script Show. After some visual YouTube only content, we’re back with an episode that also works as an audio podcast too. Here we’re looking at a longstanding debate, which seems to get more significant all the time. That is whether or when to go a static or dynamic route when building websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this podcast is focused on catching up with changes in the web platform, we don’t generally talk about third party frameworks and platforms, but as the show’s own website gets larger, we may need help to manage it. This has left us with the static. Dynamic dilemma, and I’m joined as always to have this chat by David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you doing, David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’m really good. yeah, so should we spoil things and say that we already know what we’re going to try and use? Yeah. for this site we’re gonna try 11, which is a static site generator. the main reason for that, is, Is that you already do a show, which is on WordPress anyway, and that’s our background anyway, so we know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a look at that, it gives us something new to do. But, I think this conversation came up. We thought, we might as well do this topic. ’cause you asked me the question with you we know each other from WordPress and I’ve been starting to learn 11 I. For the idea of making kind of large content sites with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you said you’re just not swapping one set of complications for another with that. And I thought, yes I am. but I thought there’s a good conversation, but why I might want to do that. So I guess, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; what this is about. It’s interesting ’cause obviously if, like me, you are heavily embedded in the WordPress ecosystem and continuing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might add, there’s a learning curve just to make WordPress work. You could really not know anything about html CSS, JavaScript, any of that, I’m sure many people do. And so you spend your time learning how to make WordPress achieve what it is that you want to achieve with code or plugins or whatever it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did get the intuition that if the no script show website needed some sort of capability to manage the content as it grows, you’ve gotta have some system in place. It can’t just be writing static HDML files and uploading them. It’d be nice to be able to automate some features or have some CMS in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did wonder what would the learning curve for 11 look like? And if it basically ended up being the same kind of learning curve that you do with WordPress, I was just thinking, what’s the point in that? You’re just swapping one difficulty for a different difficulty. And so that was why I prompted that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which then in the background led you to create the content for this episode, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I. More logically, I think it’s more appropriate for this show because what we tried to do is make it different from what we were doing with WebPress to get back to relearning the web platform. And mostly it was geared around the idea of keeping it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So we don’t talk about the other stuff, but obviously we’ve moved to that point here, and this is probably why it’s more logical because. If we go with something like Eleventy in particular, which I’ll discuss later, it allows you to opt in gradually for what you need, rather than start with this kind of monolith system where even with the JAMstack type stuff, you can end up that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we bring up the website where we’ve got some of the notes to just guide us through our conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I, would just say at this point, if it’s all right, David, that I, have no experience with Eleventy at all, so really I’m just your. The here today to be a foil. if anything doesn’t make sense to me, I’m going to ask you what’s going on and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve had various conversations with you. You’ve outlined how it works and what have you. But if I end up being incredibly ignorant, apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; apologies to anybody who’s in the levity community ’cause they really clever people there. And I’m just. just starting to grapple with it to understand it, but not having really any JavaScript background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is a program that runs on JavaScript. I’m really not that knowledgeable. Okay. So I’m probably gonna stuff up with the things that I say. But anyway, let’s, and I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just say though, at this point it, it’s interesting because it has excited you though. yeah. And obviously in these videos we try not to be that person, you’re just demonstrating how excited you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s fair to say that you are really. Pleased that you’ve come across this and you’ve obviously explored a load of different options and this is the one that you’ve got into. And so in a way, in a sense, I’m happy that you found it. ’cause it, you used to have that same feeling I think about WordPress and now you’ve, you’ve swapped it for this, so that’s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got another project to get your teeth into. It’s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and particularly with that, it’s quite what’s quite interesting and it’s. It wasn’t known at the time. I didn’t really understand the 11 t. I didn’t know what the options were if you wanted something outside of WordPress, and certainly on that kind of JAMstack side, but it turns out that most of the people I’ve ended up talking about on this show, the people that are getting me back into the web platform and learning CSS, again, are a lot of the people who are big fans of this particular thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So interesting. It’s yeah, it’s like I found the thing that might. Fit my needs best. it’s gonna depend. So let’s start with the site, what this site needs, because it’s becoming, we’ve done 30 sort of bits of content. some of it hasn’t even gone on to the site. We haven’t redesigned it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I. We are we getting to the point where doing it manually, as I am just writing out the HT ml and sticking up a new page on it, is getting a bit, tedious, particularly with the SEO stuff, right? That has to go in there. So we need, as I’ve listed there, a quicker way to write a. Posts and obviously WordPress or a dynamic system is likely to give you a text editor where you are more likely to go if you are on the static Versions of that is using markdown, which is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty new to me. Are you familiar with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m familiar with it, but it’s never been something that, that gelled with me. I’ve always preferred, basically not mark down. I’ve always preferred to write the text and then highlight the bits and then add the correct formatting via some kind of editor, be it tiny MCE or now the block editor in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just works with me. I know people who are just huge fans of Mark down. To the point where, you know, any app that doesn’t support markdown, be that like a note taking app or what have you, they just won’t use it. ’cause they, it’s become part of their muscle memory. So for me, no, but I understand its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it’s a big thing in the WordPress community. A lot of people, there’s plugins, you can add it in if you want to, if you wanna work with that. but yeah, Yeah, so it’s something I’m gonna have to learn to speed up the writing of these posts if I want to do it that way. With markdown, I think you’ll only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; need a handful of shortcuts if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you know, headings and links and there won’t be too much. I think that you need to commit to memory. So I think once you’ve got 10 things in your head, that’ll probably be all that you need for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it makes it. I think, writing with Mark down is quicker than actually using the text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I gotta get used to that. But an easy way, and this is really the key thing, I think adding in the SEO stuff that you do when you want a different description on that and it gets a little bit more complex with, Some of that stuff, particularly with the open graph stuff, if you want a particular image to show, which we often do on this one, sitemaps and RSS feeds, all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way to automate the tags and categories, which we’ve effectively got two categories. There were the sort of separate learn videos that I did separate to our main podcast and, now we’ve already, because we. We don’t know where this show’s going. We’ve already ended up with a third, which is our kind of YouTube only content, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. a way to be able to organize that kind of stuff. And also, a way of being able to add the performant YouTube videos, which I’ve had to do manually each time, to, yeah, it’s it’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting looking at those bullet points because for my need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; WordPress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; satisfies that in, every one of those bullet points works really well with WordPress. from the perspective of this and the endeavor that we’re doing here, it it’s interesting to see those things are now the bare minimum of what you need. It basically boils down to four or five things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And if you can find a platform that satisfies those four or five things, then you’ve hit gold. yeah. Okay. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; there might be a few other things, like dates and stuff like that. Yeah. Okay. You could write those in if you want modified date to do automatically as soon as you change the post and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. things that you could do with both systems. So yeah, the dilemma of static or, dynamic and in all honesty, when I thought we’d be doing this show, what I thought we’d probably end up doing is doing a kind of WordPress, version of it first. Because obviously it’s what we know, but I didn’t really realize until recently that this is a bit of an old debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I understand it, it’s like dynamic obviously came in the early two thousands. Obviously WordPress, not the newest of them came in, what, 2003?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so. Yep. And that took care of the fact that, we needed to have. Lots and lots of pages on as such and things like blogs and that take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did, what I didn’t realize is that the whole question of is dynamic all we need or is kin static play a role was already there. There was jackal, which, I’ll bring up the website. I know this is going out as audio, but, It won’t make any difference to this. I’ll just bring up their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is, a static site generator that’s been running off Ruby since about 2008, I think. Okay. still popular, so it’s not exactly as if, this concept is new. It’s quite new to me. And I guess with that, the popular term, JAMstack coming in. Probably from about 2000, not sure 15, 16 or onwards. it’s probably changed things and what we can do with JavaScript now is changed things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, the idea of being able to statically, generate these things and. Zach Leatherman, the author behind Eleventy, who I was listening to him and he was pointed to an article, bake Don’t Fry by Aman Schwartz, which, dates back to 2002 where he set off some kind of debate questioning. dynamic, whether we should be doing it on a computer end rather than having to generate the content that the user sees Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a live server, then that’s really what we’re talking about, I think. Yeah. yeah, WordPress, as I said, was the obvious choice, because. As we know, it’s the most successful plugin platform. It’s quick and easy to set up with no developer skills, massive range of themes and plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pretty much any functionality or look that you might want, you could probably get out the box. We know it. It’s well funded, it’s got that background, although it’s a little bit topical at the moment, but we won’t get into that. But for me, the downsides for this site show, was that we’re all about the, the code about, working with the CSS and learning all of that new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to have something that could, we could have complete control of the. Source code that we’re outputting, particularly as we’re gonna use our site as well as an example sometimes of the things that we talk about. And I think you can lose that with WordPress. You don’t get such same control over things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. you do, have that control, but the, barrier to that, you have to spend many, hours, years possibly really understanding how WordPress is built and constructed in order to learn how to strip out what you don’t want and put in exact. What you do want, which is why I guess enterprise agencies in the WordPress space can charge enterprise level, fees for their products, which presumably spit out exactly what the client wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, it sounds like 11 is the opposite. You start with kind of nothing and you build in the bits that you want, as opposed to WordPress, which has a ton of stuff out the box that you then have to maybe strip out if it’s not exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, exactly. It is working from the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s not just the, where the dynamic stuff happens. Which, in our case is on the, our own personal computers rather than on the server. But it’s also about, I think the approach generally, although not necessarily true of all static site generators, they come with their own set of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But certainly with Eleventy, it is the kind of, it’s been purposely made with the idea that. Zach Leatherman, the person behind it is really of the belief that most people should be able to make their websites with just plain old the web platform. Yeah. H ml and CSS. Yep. And then if you do need the dependencies, you can just add ’em in as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s been the kind of approach to that particular project. the thing is though, why I thought we might not do it, because just before I, got into looking into 11, I really got into the idea of using the classic theme and building on WordPress and building my own setup with that one and coding it from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re to move over and go to modern, WordPress with it, you have to get into the block themes really, if you’re to take advantage of going forward that route. So then that requires me skills that I don’t have or I’m not going to need. It’s going to box me into. The kind of WordPress React route or something to learn to have that same control over things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So are you meaning particularly JavaScript skills that you might need to have? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So somebody can, they can control their code output on WordPress, but you probably need some extra skills if you’re going to go the new modern. JavaScript first route with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s, so that kind of, that, that kind of skilled me outta the situation even though I don’t have JavaScript skills and it, I don’t wanna be boxed in so much to one particular, JavaScript, if you like, or one approach with that, Got it. yeah. Yeah. So the other downside is that we would, if we use WordPress, then we wouldn’t be learning an alternative, which is always good to know, different things that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’d have to pay for our hosting and there might be some other things that we’d have to pay for caching, backup, security, that kind of stuff that I do on the WordPress sites that I manage. It is not so easy to ’cause something I would quite like to do with our shows. For the last three episodes that we did, we made a demo site to Yeah, and made that public for anybody if they wanted to use it just to analyze it or use bits of it in the start of their projects, which I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d like to be able to do is to do some. not necessarily a CMS version of it, but just use, add a, an eleventy version of it. Yeah. And it would be a lot easier to do that by just adding some extra things, like there’s a permanent header and footer template and you just change the content for extra pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to make a version of that. That would be. It would be more difficult to share that with people if I wanted to do a WordPress version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So do you mean you might atomize the site? So you, okay, if you like this header here’s the bit for the header and if you like this footer, here’s the bit for the footer, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’d be able to share those components, those&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; jigsaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the risk sharing that what all I was thinking of, say we did the bistro site that we did. Yeah. And that was just an example. If I made a version of that, I could decide, and I think we’ll do this, maybe we’ll do this as the next episode, just show how you could just add 11 two to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So say on that bistro site as say, there’s a lot more pages you want on it, and I think. Okay. That means I have to change the header and the photo on each. Got it. Pages. Got it. I can turn this so I can do a CMS version if you like, one that you can do. there something that makes it easier to manage your content really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I’m not talking about, UI or anything like that. Okay. But yeah, also the intended audience. I think it’s the downside for this one is to say, we’re really about getting back to the web platform and learning stuff there. And partly because WordPress is. More popularly seen as a no code solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s really not fair when all the people are really serious developers who use WordPress, but generally it’s seen as that where our show is a bit about Pumping up a little bit how lovely and friendly code can be these days. Yeah. so it’s more suiting to that different audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Great. Yeah, so that’s that. also, let’s talk a bit about the static site generators. So there is, there do seem to be gaining popularity at the moment. So there was the. 2024 Web Almanac, which, was just so in showing that there’s a 67% growth in static and hybrid website. A, architectures amongst the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is difficult for me to say for some reason, 10,000 most visited sites. Gosh, that’s a lot. Wow. It’s, it is a huge growth. Yeah. I mean there is, there is, talk of it here, obviously Cloud Canyon, because they, do a CMS for static. People are obviously going to promote that. I think there is something, if you actually go to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itself, the way of being able to measure that’s quite tricky is particularly with something like Eleventy, because you can’t tell Eleventy is being used ‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; cause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Eleventy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t put anything out to identify itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. anybody interested in that would probably just want to go and look at, the table of contents and probably the jump stack area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because they’ve had to assess on the basis of speed. I believe how. what sites are statically generated and what’s are being dynamically. Okay. So it might not be entirely accurate, but Right. It does seem that there is a trend towards that. And obviously that’s where the growth has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s other static site generators like Astro 11 is fairly stable, but it’s still been growing over the years that it’s been around. So there is a general growth in those. So there is that, but there are some general problems. Shall we just quickly cover those? Yeah, problem. Let’s go for it. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. These are problems that WordPress solves for you, for other people, which is you do need some skills and you certainly need a willingness, I think, to use a terminal to do command line rather than a nice friendly ui. So that’s still something which is a bit alien to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think, a lot of people, that is already a bridge too far, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you Exactly. really getting the terminal out for. The vast majority of the people online is a, is too much. It’s immediately hostile and weird and too scary. So you’ve probably put 99% of the population out with that one bullet point, but for those 1% who love it and are willing to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Fair enough point taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and the interesting thing, having, I’m in that, it’s no, I’m not judging that, don’t do that. But now. because it’s a few simple commands and if it’s set out with instructions, how to do it. Yeah, it’s actually quite simple. it’s actually a lot simpler than dealing with most of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; ui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, are you in effect then memorizing the things that you need as opposed to having an understanding of, ever every single thing that you type? Is it more a set of, okay, this is now part of my muscle memory. I know that at this point I need to type this into the terminal even though I don’t fully understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the time, when it’s set up, all I’m ever doing is wanting to just run or serve at 11, which is just basically, I, you just do a run command. It’s that one command, and I’ve put it into a short key anyway, so it just, it’s, I don’t have to think to get it up and running. But of course when you’re installing all these different packages, which is what you do with these things, it’s, it’s all made possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why it’s popular now I think, is because we have. No js, which allows us to pull in all these packages and work on our local environment. So the idea of installing all these different packages and controlling those is, scary. It was scary to me. It’s still scary to me, but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so far, yeah, you never really see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you, you, you don’t quite get a visual. you get it in the terminal, you get some sort of. Text-based feedback that things have happened, but okay, where did those packages go? What just happened? Where is it on my computer? How can I get to it? And, of course the answer is you don’t really need to, anyway, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, okay. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, that’s, brilliant. It’s exactly my experience. and, but now, it’s starting to go, oh, it’s not that difficult at all actually. Yeah. And it just works anyway, and I know where it’s going. Yes. Yeah. I, it. It’s surprising how quickly you change and how it’s not as difficult as you first think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, yeah, and the other problem of course, with a static site generators is there are, so many choices out there. No industry standard. You can’t really look at this. If I just go over to the Jam Stack site here, we’ll see now on their filter here, it’s listing 365 different generators. Now, gosh, in all honesty, some of them you wouldn’t really think of as a site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I just go to this on license, we’ll see this WP two static, which is a, now I think defunct. I tried to use this actually a way of turning, a WordPress site into a static site. it maybe does work. It didn’t work the last time I tried it. You, have a solution to do that, don’t you? That you use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I’m not using that one, but I, have a plugin which enables me to turn static to turn WordPress websites into static, and then it shuffles it over to Netlify or. Bonnie, CDN or whatever, Amazon, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah. I, it may be listed on there. I don’t think it is, but, no. Yeah, there, there are some big players that everybody knows about because of the popularity of reactors, library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then next JS goes with that as a sort of static site generator for that. Hugh goes very popular because it’s quick, but it’s built on a language like go. And then we have all these other ones, which are perhaps. Declining in the popularity that were heavy, that were very much JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is one of those, popular ones coming forward now are Astro and stuff like this. The big, really what I’m trying to show here is the fact that there is so many choices, not one absolute leader in the area as there is with the dynamic with WordPress. And many of these will now be. Not broken, but they will not be getting the support that they need, Funding these things is, quite a tricky thing. So there, I think there are some downsides that go. if you move towards this static site generator, way many as retired as I’ve put here, but there’s also a lot to go into setting up a blog. Like we’re saying, all these different components that you make up in just your head or alone, we’re saying, oh, I want this image and this description to come in for Facebook, a different one for Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all of that kind of stuff. you’re gonna have to code all these different lines in, if you want the dates to do this, you have to do this if you are doing it manually. So there’s a lot of elements Yeah. that you have to do. And also, the big thing is that it’s the criticism, of setting site generators is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this benefit as well, but it’s cobbled together out of various bits of tech. it’s, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you said, it’s a house of cards. There’s this whole sort of, exactly that House of Cards, you remove one card halfway up the stack and many, more things collapse as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for our job, of course, the main thing is though, I don’t think it’s that relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted a, a ui, a CMS type UI for. Multi-author where we’re both adding to this, then that’s an extra complexity on top of the stuff that you have to do that. And there are, there is a free option. There’s dcap, which is great, which you could use, as a free CMS to do that. But otherwise they get quite expensive if you want to set them up and make ’em a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there’s no inbuilt comment, none of the dynamic stuff, of course, that you get on the service or the commenting system or the search. But then. I think that’s a topic. We could do a whole topic on this. What there are other solutions here. ’cause you could argue also on the WordPress side that things like caching make the commenting system difficult anyway and searches, and particularly I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good. Unless you do some work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, but it’s interesting ’cause they are all, they’re all parts of the thought process to going in, if you can’t tick all those boxes, it may be dynamic isn’t something that you wanna put on the shelf. Maybe dynamic is something that you want to do, WordPress and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if those things are things that you can cope with, particularly the second to last one, the multi-author bit. Yes. then yeah, go static and and. You’ve been through this process, and here’s the next bullet point, Why 11? That’s where you’ve settled? Yeah. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got 360 plus to choose from. Why that one? How did that make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; its way to the top? Exactly. I’ll just take one thing actually just on the commenting system. We’ll just go back on that one ’cause it maybe is worth talking about it. ’cause one thing that interests me and maybe the easier route, although it’s in WordPress as well, is to, I’m quite interested in web mentions and all of that indie stuff, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And how you could employ them on sites. But anyway, sorry. Why 11 two? So why really? Why have I. Move towards that. I guess it’s the people that I’ve been following recently. I’ve talked about that. mainly because let’s just go over to their site ’cause it says it all on there because it’s, pictures itself as the simpler static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s probably the easiest route in for somebody like me who doesn’t understand JavaScript. so that’s probably the key thing. Lemme just have a look. It’s un opinionated. Is that a proper word? Yeah, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; think so. Yeah. It does not have an opinion is on opinionated. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. In the sense that you’re not gonna know if 11 is being used unless declare it in some sort of way where even with the other static site generators, they’re probably likely to output something to help you along your way, which will give away that it is that particular static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s, I think it’s the only example I can think of that. Yeah, that’s really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting. ’cause yeah, you would’ve thought even to just promote the project, it would be, it’s a choice that they’ve made deliberately to have the ht ML or whatever is being surfaced on the front end. To deliberately strip out everything, which shows that it has been built with 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you think back to the origins of the project, that could have been a very sensible thing to put in because as the project grew, more people would, right click view source, ah, eleventy. Interesting. I’ll go and explore that. But they’ve made the decision to have none of that in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know that free marketing has gone away, but, for the benefit of the speed of the website and all of that, it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And, when we say they, it’s really one man. It’s leatherman. Yeah. Yeah. it’s been his project, which is, yeah, it’s just been that, his journey has been WordPress to jackal, to, creating eleventy as a version of jackal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do static site and he’s got these kind of things, which made me align with it, His approach to the web. okay. but it is very flexible because, lemme just go to their site again because it lists these, I think it does over here. no it doesn’t. let me go over to some of my other points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s used on a lot of well-known sites already,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh, no kidding. Look at that. Yeah. Nasa,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve got the W three C now. It’s used for various different pages. Yeah, it might be a sub domain of something, but still, yeah. WordPress is also used on nasa, so there’s overlap with this, where it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web dev, notify, lots and lots of different Chrome developers, so it’s got good. And it’s got really good people. That’s the main thing here. I’ve listed a few of ’em out, but I can see them here as people who contribute to it. Who, so I can see here, there’s, her name’s just gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miriam. Suzanne. There you go. Miriam, Suzanne. Yes. somebody writing that. I see Michelle Barker over here. I’m sure if I stared at this. Oh yes. I can see Stephanie Eccles. Lots of people here that we mention who are big fans of that. Let me go back to the notes here, ’cause I’m. Getting sidetracked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the other thing is as well, if you are using something like 11 T compared to say, another JAMstack solution, what it’s known for is its quick build times, which is quite important. So you’re building your end and you’re probably rooting it through to GitHub, which is then going on to something like gi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify. Yeah. And you, and there’s a cost to the build time on that. So if it takes a very long time, which something like Gatsby can take, 20 if not a hundred times longer than something like 11 t could to do similar number of pages. So it’s quite good on that if you want to stay within your free allowance, I’ve put it down as a benefit, that it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VC funded, venture capital is funded. Okay. But it’s also a negative I think, as well. Yeah, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; mean you’ve got that whole hit by a boss thing, haven’t you with it. if it’s one person, that means it’s great. You’ve got this one point of contact, but also you’ve got this one point of failure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; 11, it’s been quite interesting ’cause obviously it’s been this personal project, it’s taken off ’cause it’s met the needs of a lot of people who share his same view about keeping things as simple as possible, and and really taken off. With particularly people who, people like Miriam, Suzanne, people who contribute to, making CSS what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so it’s taken off, but Netlify funded it for some time. cloud Canyon did that because they were CMS. That’s use things like Astra and Eleventy or stuff like that. now I think to, it has been self-funded for some time, which is. Some of these people over here were some of the contributors to, they were paying their own money to use it to help him to put more time into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just recently, and I dunno what difference that’s gonna make to things, he’s just joined the font awesome team who are doing another product, which is, it’ll come to me in a minute. Something we can Okay. That’s Webber awesome. Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Oh yeah. I’d heard of that. Yeah, that’s gone out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve forgotten what that is. You saw that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Fantastic video. Yes. yeah. Yeah, that’s right. So yeah, so it’s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, it’s a part of that. That video was fantastic. That video was like, it was shot in Hollywood or something. That was incredible. Anyway, sorry, what an aside. Okay, moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and that’s it really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably just covered the. The main things were the things that came up in your mind about this? No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the, I’m just curious to see because I, like I said, I haven’t used it. I’m a staunch WordPress fan, and I can, totally see why some of these things have got your, got your intuitions, you just wanna be out there and figuring out how all this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just keen to see how it works and in the end. How it works in terms of, being, let’s say a time saver. Now, I, know that there’s all the arguments about, okay, I don’t want a bloated CMSI don’t wanna pay for server time. That’s not being used. I don’t have a need for a commenting system and all that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m, interested to see how it saves time and money over time. I think they’re the two things that I wanna see from this, how quick is it to. Get up and running, how quick is it to create a page? How quick is it to, I don’t know, implement some of the designs like the bento one that you did recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How quick is it to inject those into it? and I’m fascinated by the cost implications. ’cause I imagine with this, the cost is for a typical, I don’t know, Brochure website for somebody living in a town, you know where there’s gonna be thousands of views a year, not millions of views a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested to see how close to free it is. ’cause I’m imagining it will approximate very close to free at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you, that’s what we’re doing at the moment, while we just do it with the basic web platform and no. Third party platform at all for this site. we check it out, we get our free hosting and I’m sure there’ll always be some free hosting for the sort of visits Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we get. The amount of traffic that we get. Yep. So really all this is building on the Y 11 to fits. It is because we can add in something to take, to remove some of the chore of having to update things that would. Come with WordPress out of the box. Yeah. there’s no doubt about it. If I was, taken on a job that, had a big, large content site and it needed multi authors and it was at my skill level, there’s no doubt it would be WordPress That would be the choice for this sort of thing if I had to do this job, because there’s no way that I would be linking all of this stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; To give them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the UI that they needed. Yeah. yeah. so that would be the obvious choice. But when it comes to this, where. Effectively, it’s only you or I might have to update the content here. obviously the benefits of static is once you stick it up there, unless you mess with it, it’s gonna live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you put, like on a dynamic platform, someone else can mess up your website for You and you have to update, don’t you? Because you know you have to. Yeah. security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; patches, things like that. Yeah. It’s interesting. I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna be fascinating. I, you are gonna, you’re gonna ring WordPress out of my cold, dead hands, but, but nevertheless, it’s a fascinating ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I’m here to watch it all happen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we, shall we do next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you could highlight what you think is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; gonna happen next time. Yeah. Okay. I think maybe we will try and we’ll take one of those, old sites. I’m not sure which ones. One of the, and I’ll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try and put some eleventy in it with my basic skills of what I know about it so far, so you can see it in action. I think we can probably do that as an audio as well, because Oh yeah, if I just explain Yeah. The process, I think it will make sense, but, we’ll definitely need YouTube so you can see what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we’ll give that a bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that sounds good to me. you’ll be able to check this out, at the No Script Show website. It’s no script show slash 15 ’cause that is the episode that we’re on. You’ll be able to find the show notes that we’re showing on the screen, but if you’re listening to it, on the audio, then there are some show notes there that you can click links on if any of the bits and pieces have raised your.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of curiosity, about 11 or indeed WordPress. So shall we call it a day? Is that a wrap? Yeah, I think so. Alright. See you. I’ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; thanks. Bye bye. Bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Frontend Divide:- UX Designers vs JavaScript Specialists</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/14/" />
    <updated>2024-07-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/14/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are revisiting a 5 year old debate summed up in Chris Coyier&#39;s 2019 CSS Tricks article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/&quot;&gt;the Great Divide&lt;/a&gt; and looking at what has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-behind-the-great-divide&quot;&gt;What&#39;s behind the &amp;quot;Great Divide&amp;quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A worry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over &amp;quot;gatekeeping&amp;quot; and gender bias. If you have to be a programmer &lt;a href=&quot;https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/01/30/html-css-and-our-vanishing-industry-entry-points/&quot;&gt;accessible routes to web development narrow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That web standards will fall?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That code complexity is a cost to the environment and users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-the-divide-exist&quot;&gt;Why does the divide exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML and CSS not meeting the (perceived) component based design needs of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS not seen as easy to scope for large scale team project work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers not being trusted. Better to use JS to tell them what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing (although Meta and Google seem to have lost interest in their React and Angular offerings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amazing real time user interaction JavaScript brought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS frustrates many. Mostly through not learning it, understanding its declarative nature and impatience. &lt;strong&gt;Rachel Andrew wrote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;CSS is simultaneously too easy to bother with, yet so hard it needs to be wrapped up in a ball of JavaScript in case it scares the horses&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-getting-smaller&quot;&gt;Is it getting smaller?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS is being rapidly refactored - removing common dependencies on JS (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://astro-zerojs-transitions.vercel.app/&quot;&gt;interactive ones&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers working together to speed up progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web components offering a standards based interoperable alternative to 3rd party JS components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS fatigue. Maintaining a complex set of dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cascade is back with &lt;code&gt;@layer. @scope and :where()&lt;/code&gt; A move to doing more with less code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebAssembly (WASM) - a new web standard with more power than JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User demands:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For web content on their terms. Increasingly removing our visual designs and expecting content on any type of device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration with CSS often came from mimicking print.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to deliver fast, green, valid and accessible HTML content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://noscript.show/img/divided.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wordpress-divide&quot;&gt;The WordPress divide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who use a WYSIWYG builder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More recently, those who develop themes as WordPress moves from PHP themes to JS block themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>What is the W3C doing about AI?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/13/" />

    <id>https://noscript.show/13/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-w3c-report&quot;&gt;The W3C Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s written as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/reports/ai-web-impact/&quot;&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt; and there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwLRtquaLOk&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on the W3C&#39;s YouTube channel. It&#39;s an open document that is first seeking community feedback via Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may lead to in-depth stakeholder interviews, W3C workshops and developing a standardisation roadmap. It&#39;s looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethical-and-societal-impacts&quot;&gt;Ethical and Societal Impacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency (data usage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy (protecting personal data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security (impersonation concerns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainability (the environmental impact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing interests (fairness to content creators and consumers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-impacts-and-standardization-proposals&quot;&gt;Technical Impacts and Standardization Proposals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consent mechanisms for Web content in AI training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of personal data stores for data control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labelling AI-generated content to combat misinformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposing model-backed Web APIs while maintaining interoperability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating the environmental impact of AI systems on the Web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting contributions on Github already. Some are questioning the threat AI poses to the Web. It does not link in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is another. Jacob Nielsen The &amp;quot;king of usability&amp;quot; thinks usability has failed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui&quot;&gt;Generative AI could do the job.&lt;/a&gt; Do we need alt tags and aria labels? Or language translation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tim-bernards-lee-ai-predictions&quot;&gt;Tim Bernards-Lee AI predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He think it will transform the way we interact with the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day we&#39;ll have AI assistants that work for us — similar to our doctors, lawyers, and bankers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The breakup of big tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His passion is for a web where users own their own data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software and skills. Today we’re talking about AI from the perspective of the W three C or the Worldwide Web Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping us with this is a new report from the W three C team called AI and the Web, understanding and Managing the impact of Machine Learning Models on the Web. Additionally, we have Tim Burners Lee AI predictions thanks to some recent comments when celebrating 35 years on the web. So David, this is a topic we both enjoy debating, so it’ll be interesting to see how our positions on AI have advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, over to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well have, we’ve been talking for about two hours before this. yes. We just couldn’t, yeah. Yeah. So we caught up on that. So we’ll try and stick, I think, as best as we can to what the W three C are saying because we can go off on so many tangents. And I think there’ll be other subjects here, won’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you my quick summary and I am in the position where I think I was excited about it and I still am. But I’ve never really bought into the fact that it’s something creative, going to threaten any creative job that I might do. I quite like how the large language machines are helping me to do some really tedious tasks these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do think it’s quite interesting ’cause it feels a little bit like we’ve moved away from that and initial hype where we are more panicked about it and we’re seeing more. Of the kind of news where companies are feeling forced a little bit to exaggerate what you can do. We’re seeing more about how it might be so much more costly to make it advance in the way that we expect it to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, so it’s quite interesting since the last time we spoke about there was more sort of panic over it, where it feels a bit more relaxed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I, flip flop on this subject. I go from a deep admiration of AI and the things that it can do to blind panic, like chicken little, the sky is falling in. And I, really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I think, the reason is because in some areas where I honestly thought, computers, let’s call it that computers could never encroach. So the creation of artwork or the creation of songs, that kind of thing. I really did think five years ago that wouldn’t be an impossibility. There was something about the human brain, which was unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then more recently when things. Which you could call art and things, which we could call music came along. It really did start to make me think, gosh, okay, this is, this is a worry. And I think the worry for me is that we’re gonna gouge out the bottom rung of the ladder. If you imagine a ladder, a career ladder if you like, and, you need people to get on the first step of the ladder in order to then progress to other things as their career goes on and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it feels like AI has the potential to just knock out the first. Bottom two steps of the ladder because it can approximate, a, decent song, it can approximate a decent logo or whatever it might be. And so I worry that the people who might have had those jobs and therefore gained experience, they’re gonna somehow have to get above what the AI can do to be useful in a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that worries me. But then equally, I think over the last year, I’m feeling this sense of plateau in what the ais can do. it doesn’t really seem like what it could do a year ago. Is that different from what it can do now? And I expected that would be logarithmic. It would just improve at a greater rate, whereas it seems to have plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other thing is with technology since let’s say the turn of the millennium, so 2000, you didn’t really know what the intention was. You didn’t really have a roadmap in your head of what the internet ought to be like. It just evolved. Where whereas with ai, you can perceive what that is and that is a replacement of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you can get an ai, AI to create a perfect film, a perfect song. you know what that is already. Whereas the internet, I don’t know what that is. I never knew what it was gonna be. So anyway, so I think on balance, I’m more sanguine about it. and certainly every time I’ve used AI for the tiny little corner of the, the AI possibilities that I use it for, I’ve been profoundly impressed by what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I have this notion in my head, which is probably self-deception in a way, because I would’ve been doing all of that work myself, and I’m not therefore doing somebody out of work. I’m just saving myself some time. I. I feel that’s a decent trade off, but obviously if that were played out across the whole world, that might not be quite such a, good endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry that was a complete rant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, it’s fine. actually there’s just, you made me think of something we didn’t even talk about before, but I think, when it might cut out that bottom layer, the fundamentals. That funny enough is where I think it fails because I think, where it’s pretty rubbish at doing stuff is like things like marking out some HML, which might be appropriate to the context it needs to be, or it’s terrible with CSS I’ve found, and I think, sometimes when it might take some of the chore out things that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;absolutely known, I used it for WordPress. Really impressive because if you like the PHP commands that you might use, the old ones for traditional WordPress are so set that there’s not much variation. So ask it to do something which I couldn’t do. It could do the code, which I couldn’t do, but I know it’s going to be correct, because there’s only so many outputs where I think, sometimes the fundamental structuring of a website or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it just doesn’t do it. And it’s same because it’s always looking backwards on its stuff. CSS has evolved particularly so it doesn’t know the new stuff and it looks back to the majority of the old stuff, which is not the best way to do it. So, I find actually in some ways it’s, I’m going back to the basics of the very early web and trying to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get to understand things, which I thought I knew, but don’t. HDML and CSS particularly as it’s changing and I think it’s so bad at those things that, yeah, it, you know, I have to guide it on the fundamentals. So I, that is my worry actually with AI is that sometimes it can be used to fill in what you think is a good example for me is AI with, I was talking about this, I did a short video AI with, ALT tags for images seems to be a new thing to do that. And you think, yeah, that’s great. But if you think about it for one second, the last thing a blind person wants is, all this wonderful prose on what this image looks like. They want to know what a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; game changing, whatever. Yeah, just over superlative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, but you remind me the whole No, what I’m saying is that, if you really describe a full image as a I Oh, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; see. Yes. It won’t know when how to truncate itself or, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. Actually what that image is doing, it wants to know what that image is doing, what parts of that image are. Are meaningful to the context in which it’s set right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest is all superfluous. Yeah. So do you see what I mean? I can see where, it’s these lower level things, some of these other jobs where I think you actually have to be a human being because you’re providing for other human beings anyway. Yeah. We’ve, no,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, but that’s interesting. And I, do wonder, I wonder particularly in the, with the example of CSS, because the CSS isn’t the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is what the CSS. Does, which is visual. Yes. I wonder if, that, if the, AI at the moment, these large language models, I wonder if they can make the connection, okay, here’s some code. But what does that actually end up looking is the point, and it might not be able to make bridge that gap, if Yeah. So maybe it’s, maybe that’s, I don’t know. I’m entirely ignorant of whether that’s even a thing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but Yeah. And for speed, I want it to be fast and in the context of the whole site, and it just can’t do it, and I just avoid it because, it just starts hallucinating as. AI does when I start, it doesn’t know stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It thinks it does, and, it, I love sending it off for down its hallucinations where it believes it’s right and it’s completely wrong, and then like to enjoy watching. But, other stuff, it’s great when, when I think when you are making the creative decisions, treating it as a. A dumb assistant I think is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we bring up the notes? Because honestly we’ll just go on. Yeah, I will do that completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; One moment. Here we go. This is the note. if you are listening to this. Let me get the number right. ’cause in the past I’ve got the numbers of the episodes wrong. So we’re on episode number 13 1 3. And so if you go to no script show slash 13 1 3, you’ll be able to find these show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have, I’ve got the episode right for a start. Yes. You have lucky for everyone. Yeah. Okay, great. So here we are. What, where should we launch first? Yeah, this W three C report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I just thought this was a good chance ’cause it’s, recently out and it’s, obviously it, the title doesn’t really beg it to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an academic paper. And, there is a presentation. I’ve got a link on the show notes, which goes to the YouTube, channel there. But the guy behind that, it’s maybe not, he’s, French, so if, if you can tune into his accent, you might find it quite interesting as a quick sort of summary of what they’re trying to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my understanding is. it comes from the W three. See team, is that what they call themselves? Yeah. Yeah. And it’s, that’s really the, they’ve got about, I think 46 employees in that team. And, this is really just a first document out there, which might later form standards. So the idea is that they put this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment it’s public, so it welcomes feedback. So it’s out on GitHub, so you can, if you think this report is missing something they should be looking into, you can add to it. And we’ll talk about that, but, We’ve got a summary. Do you wanna just run through these, Nathan? We’ve got, I’ve tried to divide it up what the report is saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. just to read what’s on the screen, really, ethical and societal. Societal is hard to say. Impacts, are transparency, data usage. These, some of them have got little parentheses at the end, privacy, which is protecting personal data security, impersonation concerns. Sustainability, the environmental side of sustainability, balancing interests, and that really refers to the fairness to the content creators and the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m sure that if you ponder each of those for just a moment, you can see in a real world example of where AI might be able to abuse. Any of those individual bits, obviously sustainability. If we all rely on AI for everything, we’re gonna be burning through carbon at an incredibly quick rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balancing interests do content creators, who, owns what if the LLMs are allowed to sock up all of the data without giving credit back, and, they appear to be the origin. Of that particular piece of content, whereas in fact it was written by somebody, I don’t know, 10 years ago or what have you, and each of them, just ponder it for a moment and you’ll be able to figure out how that might be of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And then I think the next, because it’s sectioned up and the next thing is really addressing those ’cause it’s the technical impact and standardization proposal. So obviously what the W three C as a standards organization for the web, it likes to ultimately come up with some standards, which we all agree to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s really addressing all of the next ones with, a sort of consent mechanism for AI content. In AI training development of personal data stores for data control, labeling of AI generated content to combat misinformation exposure, sorry, exposing model. Backed web IPAs while maintaining interoperability and evaluating the environmental impact of AI systems on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just say the, I do like the idea of a web, IPA, which is what you’ve actually said. A, web-based Indian pale ale. That would be, really nice. I think you meant to say API, but I prefer I did. I prefer what you said. Can I just say though, just getting back before you put this document together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I didn’t really know anything about this at all, and I honestly didn’t think this was any concern. I. Of the W three CI, I couldn’t in my head, have imagine, why do they, wanna get involved with this? and then of course when you put this together and I started thinking about it, really, somebody’s got to be thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s really where it comes down because it has to be some sort of more global approach, an approach where big business doesn’t get its tendrils where government doesn’t necessarily get its tendrils. And All of a sudden the penny dropped. And I thought, actually, yeah, this is brilliant. We do need people who are detached from it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they have no economic motive, no political motive, whatever it may be. it’s brilliant that they’re thinking about this and, they seem like fairly sensible defaults starting positions. Yeah. yeah. Anyway, sorry. You carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I, had the same thought as well. It’s trying to understand what the W three C has, and I think it does have a unique power when we’ve talked about before with, the working groups, particularly with CSS, how, within those working groups, it’s bringing to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big tech. It’s bringing Microsoft, apple, Google, Adobe to agree what they think the web should look like, these standards. So it’s obviously the best body given that AI pretty much appears through the web. What other organization could get everybody around the table? And you can see we were talking about this a little bit earlier about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How there might be a benefit to say Google because its main business is through its advertising, through its search. particularly that’s its main business. One of its biggest worries and one of the things they’re tackling here is how do we mark up on the web stuff so people know it’s AI generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, Google want that more than anything for their own business, as well as being on the side of. Supplying AI as well. They also want to control that for that aspect of their business. So there’s a good reason for everybody to try and agree things, I think, to some standards. So where is expected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VER developers, who when we’re putting sites together that we declare our. AI content, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think it’s gonna be really difficult for the W three C to have teeth in this, in that it’ll be easier for them to just create some recommendations, which we, we would hope people would follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe this will be one of those situations. So for example, at the moment. It does appear that accessibility. So nothing to do with AI for a moment, just accessibility is gaining teeth because politicians around the world are, putting laws together, which say, look, unless you do this, you are gonna feel the, strong arm of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if your website is not accessible in these certain ways. And here’s the guide, here’s the guidance for how that should look. but now we’re gonna give it teeth. And that’s coming around in next year in the eu. Maybe this sort of stuff over time will need that approach as well, because you can imagine it’ll be easy to just ignore any of those points and just say, yeah, nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my country, the jurisdiction that I live in, doesn’t compel me to do it, so I’m not gonna do it. Yeah, I’m gonna steal that content and claim it as my own. Who cares? so we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the idea of this report is that it does, it is the first stage in it, so right at the moment it’s out there as a, partly written document where people can add in their views and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be, and there’s a couple of ’em will come onto that minute, so this, but then they’ll move on to stakeholder interviews, which I guess we’ll be talking to the likes of Google. Yeah. Microsoft and what they’re doing on that, and then it’ll move into the. W three C workshops in the way that they might go about standardizing anything like CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. But I think, surely it should be welcomed by, when you think that you might have Microsoft competing with Google over, I’m sure everybody wants this to be a success in, The end. So if everybody can agree some standards of which they will work to on the web, then it’s to the benefit of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that’s where they are unique. But yeah, it does seem a little odd to me. when, ’cause most of our news about AI is not really, you think of it as a separate endeavor and one which potentially. And that’s another argument of it could remove the need for the web entirely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. You’re imagining a scenario where you’ve just got this little pocket assistant or something, and a lot of the things that you’re doing on the web, you’ve now consigned to this ai, which is sitting in a device in your pocket or something like that. And you don’t need to browse webpages because I don’t know, you just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask it a question and it provides you with an answer. Yeah. It undermines what the internet has become. Yeah. This is, honestly, this is so interesting. I with those ethical and societal impacts, I’m, I can’t think of anything that they’ve missed, but I’m sure that you’re right. As the days, weeks, and months go on, I’m sure there’ll be other things thrown in there, but at the moment we do seem to be in a cycle of hype, and I’m seeing it more like that as a cycle a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulfilling prophecy, if you like, where one AI company promises a thing. And so the other AI companies have to over promise because of that promise. And then, the original one then has to over promise. And we do seem to be in an ear at the moment and you only have to watch the tech conferences, Google’s io and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they portray AI being this entirely benign. Perfect force where you, are, you show it a thing and it tells you what it is, and you ask it a question and it gives you the right answer. And, it does really seem the hype cycle that we might have had for things like crypto or NFTs a little while ago, and, maybe give it a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That cycle will just, people will realize. You know what? It can’t do everything for me, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I mean there’s certainly, that’s cynical. We’ve been watching some videos that have come out, by, business people who will just say this whole AI thing is exactly like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s another thing. It was big data before that. It’s been, wearables, it’s been Bitcoin, it’s been, and this is just another, Raising funds. Silicon Valley hype hoax if you like. and certainly I think people have been caught into, as we know with Google, it cheated, and got found out for showing some of its demonstrations of what its AI can do where, it’s supposed to be able to identify certain shapes and tell you exactly where it was, where it needed human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we had a big thing with Amazon as well, where they claim it was a success, but it needed all of these. operatives in India creating the, it was a checkout for their store where they didn’t need to go and purchase anything but cameras with, real people were doing it. And now they claim the a l was a success, but they still closed it down and they still removed a lot of their documentation before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there’s a certain element where I’m sure none of these companies wanting to get into this kind of, almost having to get into lives if you like to compete. Yeah. Somebody starts it with an exaggeration, somebody else has to beat it because we’re in competition and they get stuck in it, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think one could, one could gently call it overpromising,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; overpromising is probably a better thing. Yeah. But I don’t think it’s, it’s probably not where any of these companies want to be. It’s just the way, that’s just the way I. Capitalism works, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everybody, you have to try and get the best competitive advantage. So I would imagine, the WCC has that ability in the past to agree, and I think we’ve only just seen that with a web where everybody agrees. Yes, the web, we want a standard set of code and we all want to agree what that one is, and we all want to make the web work on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I, I can see how it can be a good place. For AI to be there. Yeah. But there is an argument, sorry, I wanted to just say something on that is I think it’s alluded to in somebody’s GitHub, addition to this, and I think it was that you could say it’s a threat to the web itself in the sense that, and I’ve seen other people talk about this, so if you say, for example, PDFs, they’re very difficult because they’re not web right to make accessible and you have to put all this embedded stuff in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they’re saying these days is that. large language machines can read that stuff and work out how the content is. So that work might not need to be done in a way. And we see that a little bit, I think with a lot of SEOs saying about Google, how when we were in the age of the big data mark, everything up with schema.org or rich snippets that they called, it was the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it up. But a lot of SEOs are saying, and it’s true of Google. They seem to be dropping the support for a lot of these things. Partly because it might be over abused, but I think it’s partly because they don’t need it so much because the machines can work out the content areas of sites based on Oh, I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their knowledge. Okay. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, yeah, some, things which, so you can get into that argument where you’re saying, a lot of the fundamentals of the webs, which we agreed to, do we need them in the same way? Do we need, old tags any longer? if they’re being read in a different way with AI and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do we need aria labels and stuff? If screen readers can detect themselves, with new technology, what a page markup is, yeah, it’s quite interesting. There is a, potential for some of the web to be undermined. with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I was gonna say something there, but I’ll wait because it is what we’re gonna come onto, but it was about the capacity of AI to actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get all of that stuff right. the dom and what have you. So shall I just scroll up a little bit more and, We’ll go onto the next little bit. okay. So we’re onto Jacob Nielsen, did you wanna mention him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, was just somebody else made the point that, in that report isn’t talking about accessibility and Jacob Nielsen, the king of usability is called Think he wrote an article, and I’ve linked to it there, that usability has failed. People don’t use their RRE labels correctly, don’t mark their HTML up in the way that screen readers can easily read them. And that generative AI could start to do that job, which is really the point I’m making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that was the point I was gonna make as well. And, I think, that kind of makes sense. Wouldn’t this be an area where AI would be. Very good because it’s got a very defined outcome, Ha. Has it been marked up correctly for a screen reader, ignoring the fact that in the future screen readers might operate in a different way for the screen readers that we’ve got today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would AI be potentially quite good at this? Because it could see, I don’t know. This is a paragraph, this is a heading that is as heading, nested within another heading. Let’s give that an H two and that an H three and whatever else we might add to the HTML, the markup. It feels like that would be an area where you could just maybe click a button and it would do a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better job than you not doing it at all, if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think that’s, I, see Jacob Nielson’s point and I see he’s had some pushback by a lot of people, disabled people actually. and I understand that pushback, and I think this is where, I don’t think that’s the right thinking because I think you do need people to markup because you need another human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking this up to make sense to human. admittedly, it’s better than nothing, but I don’t think it’ll get rid of the idea that marking up. documents with HTML properly, with a concentration on accessibility. And I think in some ways it’s, skipping the point as you raised the fact that next year we’ve got a European law, which is requiring many of us to do our websites in a more accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it’s right in the fact that it’s failed, but then there’s been nobody policing this. And I think we’re seeing more policing of it. And I think human beings marking up documents rather than letting. AI do it is better because they will mark it up with the context of how it’s expected to be explained in the same way that I said about alt text as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no point in describing the whole flipping thing. It’s really how that image relates. does it relate at all? If not, it needs a blank and don’t read it out to people who don’t need to know it. Yeah. it’s just decorative and I don’t think AI can then distinguish that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so it, the AI might be better than doing nothing at all. But it’s probably not gonna be as good as doing something with humans, if I think that’s a sensible default position. Yeah. if your organization is gonna do something, it would appear that just clicking a button and praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the AI didn’t hallucinate its way into just nonsense is probably not gonna get you out of legal woes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then we’ve got Tim burners Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So he’s been, because he’s been the 35th anniversary of the web. Yeah. Gosh. I know it’s getting old. yeah. so yeah, he’s made a, it’s, there’s a couple of things and I’ve linked to them on the bottom of this and maybe I’ll add some more links in ’cause we referenced some things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, so he’s done an open letter. About the web, which talks about that. But also there’s another article which is, by CNBC, where they’re going to some of his predictions and included in that is, is AI or as I’m seeing on my notes, it says A one. Yeah, A road in the uk there’s gonna be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. So the big takeaways from this I’ve added to that was the fact that he thinks it’s gonna transform the way we interact with the web. And Google interestingly have been like that as well recently saying, let you know, let Google do the Googling for you. I. This is new take on what we expect the deal to be with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, he’s saying that’ll transform how we inter interact and he sees I’m not so optimistic as him that we’ll all have AI assistance do work for, similar to how our doctors, lawyers, or bankers do. So. he’s very optimistic, isn’t he? About AI more so than me and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; What, do, you know what, that almost to me sounds like a bit of a dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s a film that I watch and it’s got nothing to do with this, but there was a film that I watched recently where, and it was a dystopian future film, but there was a bit where, the, protagonist, the character in the film went up and talked to a robot to get his prescription. And, there was an actual robot, which, it had a flat lights flashing on the mouth, but no other moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it was just this, horrific conversation of, I’m owed this thing, can I have it? we don’t seem to have this for, really robotic voice. Anyway, back and forth, and just nothing but frustration. And I, that concerns me, that piece because that seems to undermine the humanity of a lot of things and that bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That be okay. Maybe that’s where we’ll go. But it, I fear that’s where we’re gonna go. It, that doesn’t seem like a, good incentive for humanity particularly, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, a lot of, services we have is because of that personal connection with people, it. Almost acting like counseling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lot of people grieve over the loss of that human connection, their trans actions. So yeah, I think he’s a little bit more optimistic, than I would be. He does also, and it’s related, it’s not under his AI predictions, but he is, predicting as he wrote in his open ledger as well about breakup of big tech as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sees that happening and I. this is the problem, isn’t it? We are in an advanced capitalist world and we are seeing that, money is going to, concentrated in certain areas. We have big tech, they have an awful lot of power, and we are seeing, To getting to the point where we have to see the US government will be taking a lawsuit out against Apple to make sure this competition there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got something new that’s just passed, doesn’t it, for the EU as well, which gives more control over big tech so it doesn’t abuse its position. So I do think there may be a need to Yeah, you, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And also interestingly, it is largely. Big tech. Which is pushing this agenda of what AI can do. there, there’s no like tin pot, little cottage industry mom and pop AI out there, which is, a good rival to something like open AI or Gemini or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big tech who are, and we mentioned it a moment ago, this self-fulfilling prophecy where they’ve got to overpromise because the other one’s overpromising and it’s the big tech doing it, and they’ve got a really big stage. And honestly, they could fill those, they could fill those presentations with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utter lies. And I think at the moment we just lap it all up because, oh, look, it can do that. That’s exciting. yeah, so I, yeah, I, think you’re right. It does appear like the legislators around the world are, have got the, sword of Damocles definitely above the heads of these big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ll see how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Governments having to take a part in this just to see that. Yeah. They don’t have too much power. And, we were talking about, how interesting it is with. Gen Z seeing things very different. Being a kind of first generation that doesn’t have job security and housing insecurity, that they are slightly cynical where, big companies where money’s going on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they change their behavior with big tech. They see in a way what’s going on, where, who has all the power with that. So I think that’s changing things on the ground. I do think, with Tim Burnley and he always sticks to this ’cause it’s partly as well, I think a business that is running is big on everything where this has to be set in the context of the fact that is ideal Web is one where the users own their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I’m a. A big proponent of that. But it’d be interesting because it would appear that some of the big tech companies, particularly Apple, it would appear that they’re moving in that direction. In that they’re it feels that although they have just. Been in chat with open AI apparently, so we’ll see if this breaks out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, is that the, AI will be done on your device, these M four chips that are coming down the pipe will be really good at doing everything on your own device. So as whereas at the moment you’re used to going to open AI or Gemini, and that’s an online. Portal, you type your things in and whether you’re using the API or the web interface, you get a result through the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It, feels like the future is gonna be doing that on your own device. So you own it and it never goes anywhere else. So maybe, Apple will justify not being broken up on that ground. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you mentioned something about there’s no, mom and pop, AI business there. It, we both watched a video, which we liked in a way, but, it was, it was on YouTube and it’s guy called Mike Pound and it’s on, it’s channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll put the link in ’cause I haven’t got it there. Okay. computer file. And this was the one, if you remember, Nathan, where he was looking at some of the scientific report. And we’re, always talking about the massive advance. Yeah. In AI and what it can do within a whole year, but all their reports or what he was looking at, we have to trust him that his reports are there, but he seemed to be sound man talking, saying that progress will slow down because the costs of getting the quality, because it’s so easy to gather a load of data and that not to be that great, which it means everything’s always looking back, but like I say, it’s rubbish with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS because there’s so little data about modern CSS and everything’s old. So to correct it you need so much more data to keep throwing at it, that the costs become too much, in terms of the businesses too advance, it becomes too much. To invest in it, to be able to get the improvements back. And then that’s the other debate, which we’ve heard a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I, you mentioned it on, your new show, about the environmental cost of AI with all of that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh boy, that’s just terrific. Yeah, I think, if you think. Googling things is bad if you, AI things, if you request an answer from an ai, you really are burning through the carbon much more quickly than just going onto a variety of websites and finding it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it’s a lot quicker, but every time you create an AI image or an AI song, or do an AI search. My understanding is that, from journalists that I think have credibility that it’s, burning through CO2, a really alarming rate and something which really shouldn’t be sustainable. so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That’s interesting. I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it does seem like there’s a little bit of a or a weariness now that this will actually pan out. like all the things, as mentioned before, the kind of Silicon Valley stuff, that’s the big thing that’s gonna make money. there’s a lot of other people as well saying, this potentially could be another.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bust,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. if it doesn’t continue to get better at an exponential rate, we’ll quickly grow tired of it. ’cause that’s the human condition, isn’t it? Yeah. And the YouTube video, which you are gonna link to but isn’t on the screen at the moment, it ha I think you did a really credible job of explaining that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, rather than the graph going upwards, it, went up for a long time because the LLM suddenly enabled things, which were not possible. And so it looked like. It was being creative and it looked like it was human almost, and it looked like it was passing the Turing test, but his, argument was that, okay, you had to consume all the data to get to that point, and then to make it twice as good as it is now is not just about putting double the amount of data in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re like a thousand times the amount of data. To get a teeny tiny improvement. So you put another billion point data points in and you get N point, N 0.1 of a percent improvement. You gotta add another 10 billion. And where does it all come from? yeah, and if we end up filling it in with AI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we’re in trouble. But it, made me more sanguine about it, it’s leveling off and potentially it won’t get any better. Obviously, we’re recording this in June, 2024 when the robots have taken over in August, 2025. we’ll have to revise this podcast,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I do think, but it takes us full circle with all the things we’re talking, which, I think when we look at the ethical and societal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact and, the things that they’re trying to standardize. It touches on all of these things, the sort of data usage, what data you are using over this. if everybody’s agreed to certain things, we’ll have proper competition rather than, do you know what I mean? Yeah. There’ll be more honesty with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I think also, something that’s not being resolved yet is the. the content creators, it’s stealing all of their work and, I think some people have done some experiments with, because it’s such a small data set, if you get into something very niche and you ask ai, it, it will almost duplicate what sort of Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; More or less you are robbing quite literally the exact Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, and some people have done some experiments where they’ve done it on something so niche or E even tested it by putting up wrong information on the web so the AI comes back with the wrong information that is on the web because it’s the only source, but it almost entirely rips off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole article that serves it back. So I think, when it comes to standardizing some of this stuff, when it starts to look into, the fairness of to content creators in some standards, and it looks to, I. the kind of data usage and it looks to what’s sustainable as well. I really hope that AI do get round the table around this, kind of things to create standards because I, it’s not in their interest, I don’t think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think AI’s promising. I think it can help us to do a lot of jobs and we both use it and love. Some of the things it can do for us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but it’s interesting though, but it, okay. So all of these organizations are made up of humans and Yeah, it is in their interest to not do this in the short term because there, there’s gonna be billionaires made there next year, and then they can just swan off and do whatever else they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the long term interest, if open AI and Google want to have an a, an AI future. That spans decades then, there is an interest. But I think one of the things that I’m concerned about at the moment is the self-interest. Yeah. Of a few people at the top of these companies who are, making money, like they’re printing it and it is in their interest to just do the nefarious stuff, to over promise to all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we, don’t seem to have a way of. Reigning those people in at the moment. That could be a very naive position. Maybe they’re full of, good intentions and I’m probably, I’m labeling them incorrectly, but it feels a bit like that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, of course. And it’s gonna happen. And I, for me, I think why I think this is good organization and I hope it does succeeded with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’cause I think, yeah. We talked about another success before when you think the web could have been lost to flash. Proprietary technology, Yeah. That could have easily, and a lot of people believed in it. It would be in the self-interest, but somehow it managed to preserve, and I think there’s never been a time where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest giants in tech I’ve got behind something like the W three C. So we see the security of this web project, and I don’t, I was saying about before, could it replace the web? I don’t think it will because it takes so long anyway for people to adopt new technology and it’s more effective the one that we’ve got and everybody is behind that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. They’re setting up of these. So I think it would be a good thing. And even if there is a lone wolf out there who, perhaps wants to exaggerate for their personal quick gain or something. ’cause that’s the danger, isn’t it? With everything. Somebody tells a lie to exaggerate something, they do really well out of that lie because people believe it and they get lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next, the only way you can compete it is with another lie and on it goes and everybody goes. Please. I wish we’d stop with this lying, and I think that’s right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, dear. I mean we’ve definitely, we’ve definitely solved that problem for everybody, haven’t we? Yeah, They’ve solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody. I,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s interesting anyway, and, just hardly going to get any attention, the fact that there is this document out there and I think, I think it’d be interesting to see how that develops and whether we get, yeah. AI standards coming from the W three C, I think that would be a fabulous thing if it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfect. I’ve taken the show notes away. so that was episode 13. That was our thoughts on, AI and the W three C’s approach to it. the show notes as always, no script show slash the episode number in this case. 13. Go and check ’em out there and, you two will be able to see Tim Burn’s Lee’s predictions as to what will happen to the A one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt it. I’m sure David will go and change that in a hurry, but that was lovely. Thank you David. Thanks. I’ll speak to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, cheers. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
