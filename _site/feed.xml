    <title>Static vs dynamic for content heavy websites</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about what to use for the show&#39;s website as the content grows. We&#39;re going to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt; partly because Nathan&#39;s show &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/15/wpbuilds.com/&quot;&gt;WP Builds&lt;/a&gt; is already about WordPress, but also 11ty might be a more logical fit for this particular show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-our-site-needs&quot;&gt;What our site needs:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quicker way to write posts. A text editor or Markdown?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier way to add SEO metadata, open graph, sitemaps and RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to automate tags and categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quicker way to add performant YouTube videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma-of-static-v-dynamic&quot;&gt;The dilemma of Static v Dynamic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old debate. Dynamic provided what we needed in the early 2000&#39;s, but even by 2008 there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a SSG (that inspired 11ty). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404&quot;&gt;Bake don&#39;t fry&lt;/a&gt; by Aaron Swartz in 2002 also got some questioning dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious choice as most successful blogging platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick and easy to set up with no developer skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive range of themes and plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well funded… although topical at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;downsides-for-this-shows-site&quot;&gt;Downsides for this show&#39;s site:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of the code output. Important to a show focussed on web standards and accessibility *.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using WP would not teach us about alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying for hosting(caching/backup/security) and time on software update and maintenance **.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not so easy offer a CMS version of our site demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intented audience. WP is seen as a no code solution. This show is about how lovely and friendly code can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* A classic theme would allow this, but control over the modern block themes requires JS skills we don&#39;t have or need.&lt;br&gt;
** We could convert WP to static for free hosting but manually that is a faff. Services that convert WP to static hosting are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;static-site-generators&quot;&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining popularity at the moment. The 2024 Web Almanac &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-rise-of-static-first-websites-why-major-brands-are-making-the-switch/&quot;&gt;shows 67% growth in static and hybrid website architectures among the top 10,000 most-visited sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-problems-with-static-site-generators-ssg-s&quot;&gt;General problems with Static Site Generators (SSG&#39;s)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs some skills or willingness to use a terminal rather than a UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many choices. No industry standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many have retired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots to set up with a blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s cobbled together out of various bits of tech. House of cards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to add the CMS yourself for a multi author blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No inbuilt commenting system or search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-11ty&quot;&gt;Why 11ty?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s 360 SSG&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstack.org/generators/&quot;&gt;listed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly the simplest way to explore SSGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unopinionated. There&#39;s no way to know you have used it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible with a range of templating languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You add complexity as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast build times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not VC funded *.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users include: W3C, UK gov, US gov, Google, Cern, NASA, A11Y Project, Web.dev and CSS Tricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fans include: Miriam Suzanne, Lea Verou, Stephanie Eckles, Heydon Pickering, Andy Bell, Chris Coyier, Michelle Barker, Sara Soueidan and Ben Myers (many people mentioned in this show).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello and welcome to the No Script Show. After some visual YouTube only content, we’re back with an episode that also works as an audio podcast too. Here we’re looking at a longstanding debate, which seems to get more significant all the time. That is whether or when to go a static or dynamic route when building websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this podcast is focused on catching up with changes in the web platform, we don’t generally talk about third party frameworks and platforms, but as the show’s own website gets larger, we may need help to manage it. This has left us with the static. Dynamic dilemma, and I’m joined as always to have this chat by David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you doing, David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’m really good. yeah, so should we spoil things and say that we already know what we’re going to try and use? Yeah. for this site we’re gonna try 11, which is a static site generator. the main reason for that, is, Is that you already do a show, which is on WordPress anyway, and that’s our background anyway, so we know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a look at that, it gives us something new to do. But, I think this conversation came up. We thought, we might as well do this topic. ’cause you asked me the question with you we know each other from WordPress and I’ve been starting to learn 11 I. For the idea of making kind of large content sites with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you said you’re just not swapping one set of complications for another with that. And I thought, yes I am. but I thought there’s a good conversation, but why I might want to do that. So I guess, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; what this is about. It’s interesting ’cause obviously if, like me, you are heavily embedded in the WordPress ecosystem and continuing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might add, there’s a learning curve just to make WordPress work. You could really not know anything about html CSS, JavaScript, any of that, I’m sure many people do. And so you spend your time learning how to make WordPress achieve what it is that you want to achieve with code or plugins or whatever it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did get the intuition that if the no script show website needed some sort of capability to manage the content as it grows, you’ve gotta have some system in place. It can’t just be writing static HDML files and uploading them. It’d be nice to be able to automate some features or have some CMS in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did wonder what would the learning curve for 11 look like? And if it basically ended up being the same kind of learning curve that you do with WordPress, I was just thinking, what’s the point in that? You’re just swapping one difficulty for a different difficulty. And so that was why I prompted that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which then in the background led you to create the content for this episode, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I. More logically, I think it’s more appropriate for this show because what we tried to do is make it different from what we were doing with WebPress to get back to relearning the web platform. And mostly it was geared around the idea of keeping it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So we don’t talk about the other stuff, but obviously we’ve moved to that point here, and this is probably why it’s more logical because. If we go with something like Eleventy in particular, which I’ll discuss later, it allows you to opt in gradually for what you need, rather than start with this kind of monolith system where even with the JAMstack type stuff, you can end up that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we bring up the website where we’ve got some of the notes to just guide us through our conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I, would just say at this point, if it’s all right, David, that I, have no experience with Eleventy at all, so really I’m just your. The here today to be a foil. if anything doesn’t make sense to me, I’m going to ask you what’s going on and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve had various conversations with you. You’ve outlined how it works and what have you. But if I end up being incredibly ignorant, apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; apologies to anybody who’s in the levity community ’cause they really clever people there. And I’m just. just starting to grapple with it to understand it, but not having really any JavaScript background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is a program that runs on JavaScript. I’m really not that knowledgeable. Okay. So I’m probably gonna stuff up with the things that I say. But anyway, let’s, and I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just say though, at this point it, it’s interesting because it has excited you though. yeah. And obviously in these videos we try not to be that person, you’re just demonstrating how excited you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s fair to say that you are really. Pleased that you’ve come across this and you’ve obviously explored a load of different options and this is the one that you’ve got into. And so in a way, in a sense, I’m happy that you found it. ’cause it, you used to have that same feeling I think about WordPress and now you’ve, you’ve swapped it for this, so that’s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got another project to get your teeth into. It’s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:04] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and particularly with that, it’s quite what’s quite interesting and it’s. It wasn’t known at the time. I didn’t really understand the 11 t. I didn’t know what the options were if you wanted something outside of WordPress, and certainly on that kind of JAMstack side, but it turns out that most of the people I’ve ended up talking about on this show, the people that are getting me back into the web platform and learning CSS, again, are a lot of the people who are big fans of this particular thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So interesting. It’s yeah, it’s like I found the thing that might. Fit my needs best. it’s gonna depend. So let’s start with the site, what this site needs, because it’s becoming, we’ve done 30 sort of bits of content. some of it hasn’t even gone on to the site. We haven’t redesigned it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I. We are we getting to the point where doing it manually, as I am just writing out the HT ml and sticking up a new page on it, is getting a bit, tedious, particularly with the SEO stuff, right? That has to go in there. So we need, as I’ve listed there, a quicker way to write a. Posts and obviously WordPress or a dynamic system is likely to give you a text editor where you are more likely to go if you are on the static Versions of that is using markdown, which is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty new to me. Are you familiar with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m familiar with it, but it’s never been something that, that gelled with me. I’ve always preferred, basically not mark down. I’ve always preferred to write the text and then highlight the bits and then add the correct formatting via some kind of editor, be it tiny MCE or now the block editor in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just works with me. I know people who are just huge fans of Mark down. To the point where, you know, any app that doesn’t support markdown, be that like a note taking app or what have you, they just won’t use it. ’cause they, it’s become part of their muscle memory. So for me, no, but I understand its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And it’s a big thing in the WordPress community. A lot of people, there’s plugins, you can add it in if you want to, if you wanna work with that. but yeah, Yeah, so it’s something I’m gonna have to learn to speed up the writing of these posts if I want to do it that way. With markdown, I think you’ll only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; need a handful of shortcuts if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you know, headings and links and there won’t be too much. I think that you need to commit to memory. So I think once you’ve got 10 things in your head, that’ll probably be all that you need for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it makes it. I think, writing with Mark down is quicker than actually using the text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I gotta get used to that. But an easy way, and this is really the key thing, I think adding in the SEO stuff that you do when you want a different description on that and it gets a little bit more complex with, Some of that stuff, particularly with the open graph stuff, if you want a particular image to show, which we often do on this one, sitemaps and RSS feeds, all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way to automate the tags and categories, which we’ve effectively got two categories. There were the sort of separate learn videos that I did separate to our main podcast and, now we’ve already, because we. We don’t know where this show’s going. We’ve already ended up with a third, which is our kind of YouTube only content, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. a way to be able to organize that kind of stuff. And also, a way of being able to add the performant YouTube videos, which I’ve had to do manually each time, to, yeah, it’s it’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting looking at those bullet points because for my need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; WordPress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; satisfies that in, every one of those bullet points works really well with WordPress. from the perspective of this and the endeavor that we’re doing here, it it’s interesting to see those things are now the bare minimum of what you need. It basically boils down to four or five things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And if you can find a platform that satisfies those four or five things, then you’ve hit gold. yeah. Okay. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; there might be a few other things, like dates and stuff like that. Yeah. Okay. You could write those in if you want modified date to do automatically as soon as you change the post and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. things that you could do with both systems. So yeah, the dilemma of static or, dynamic and in all honesty, when I thought we’d be doing this show, what I thought we’d probably end up doing is doing a kind of WordPress, version of it first. Because obviously it’s what we know, but I didn’t really realize until recently that this is a bit of an old debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I understand it, it’s like dynamic obviously came in the early two thousands. Obviously WordPress, not the newest of them came in, what, 2003?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so. Yep. And that took care of the fact that, we needed to have. Lots and lots of pages on as such and things like blogs and that take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did, what I didn’t realize is that the whole question of is dynamic all we need or is kin static play a role was already there. There was jackal, which, I’ll bring up the website. I know this is going out as audio, but, It won’t make any difference to this. I’ll just bring up their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is, a static site generator that’s been running off Ruby since about 2008, I think. Okay. still popular, so it’s not exactly as if, this concept is new. It’s quite new to me. And I guess with that, the popular term, JAMstack coming in. Probably from about 2000, not sure 15, 16 or onwards. it’s probably changed things and what we can do with JavaScript now is changed things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, the idea of being able to statically, generate these things and. Zach Leatherman, the author behind Eleventy, who I was listening to him and he was pointed to an article, bake Don’t Fry by Aman Schwartz, which, dates back to 2002 where he set off some kind of debate questioning. dynamic, whether we should be doing it on a computer end rather than having to generate the content that the user sees Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a live server, then that’s really what we’re talking about, I think. Yeah. yeah, WordPress, as I said, was the obvious choice, because. As we know, it’s the most successful plugin platform. It’s quick and easy to set up with no developer skills, massive range of themes and plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pretty much any functionality or look that you might want, you could probably get out the box. We know it. It’s well funded, it’s got that background, although it’s a little bit topical at the moment, but we won’t get into that. But for me, the downsides for this site show, was that we’re all about the, the code about, working with the CSS and learning all of that new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to have something that could, we could have complete control of the. Source code that we’re outputting, particularly as we’re gonna use our site as well as an example sometimes of the things that we talk about. And I think you can lose that with WordPress. You don’t get such same control over things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. you do, have that control, but the, barrier to that, you have to spend many, hours, years possibly really understanding how WordPress is built and constructed in order to learn how to strip out what you don’t want and put in exact. What you do want, which is why I guess enterprise agencies in the WordPress space can charge enterprise level, fees for their products, which presumably spit out exactly what the client wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, it sounds like 11 is the opposite. You start with kind of nothing and you build in the bits that you want, as opposed to WordPress, which has a ton of stuff out the box that you then have to maybe strip out if it’s not exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, exactly. It is working from the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s not just the, where the dynamic stuff happens. Which, in our case is on the, our own personal computers rather than on the server. But it’s also about, I think the approach generally, although not necessarily true of all static site generators, they come with their own set of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But certainly with Eleventy, it is the kind of, it’s been purposely made with the idea that. Zach Leatherman, the person behind it is really of the belief that most people should be able to make their websites with just plain old the web platform. Yeah. H ml and CSS. Yep. And then if you do need the dependencies, you can just add ’em in as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s been the kind of approach to that particular project. the thing is though, why I thought we might not do it, because just before I, got into looking into 11, I really got into the idea of using the classic theme and building on WordPress and building my own setup with that one and coding it from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re to move over and go to modern, WordPress with it, you have to get into the block themes really, if you’re to take advantage of going forward that route. So then that requires me skills that I don’t have or I’m not going to need. It’s going to box me into. The kind of WordPress React route or something to learn to have that same control over things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So are you meaning particularly JavaScript skills that you might need to have? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So somebody can, they can control their code output on WordPress, but you probably need some extra skills if you’re going to go the new modern. JavaScript first route with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s, so that kind of, that, that kind of skilled me outta the situation even though I don’t have JavaScript skills and it, I don’t wanna be boxed in so much to one particular, JavaScript, if you like, or one approach with that, Got it. yeah. Yeah. So the other downside is that we would, if we use WordPress, then we wouldn’t be learning an alternative, which is always good to know, different things that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’d have to pay for our hosting and there might be some other things that we’d have to pay for caching, backup, security, that kind of stuff that I do on the WordPress sites that I manage. It is not so easy to ’cause something I would quite like to do with our shows. For the last three episodes that we did, we made a demo site to Yeah, and made that public for anybody if they wanted to use it just to analyze it or use bits of it in the start of their projects, which I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d like to be able to do is to do some. not necessarily a CMS version of it, but just use, add a, an eleventy version of it. Yeah. And it would be a lot easier to do that by just adding some extra things, like there’s a permanent header and footer template and you just change the content for extra pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to make a version of that. That would be. It would be more difficult to share that with people if I wanted to do a WordPress version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So do you mean you might atomize the site? So you, okay, if you like this header here’s the bit for the header and if you like this footer, here’s the bit for the footer, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’d be able to share those components, those&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; jigsaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the risk sharing that what all I was thinking of, say we did the bistro site that we did. Yeah. And that was just an example. If I made a version of that, I could decide, and I think we’ll do this, maybe we’ll do this as the next episode, just show how you could just add 11 two to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So say on that bistro site as say, there’s a lot more pages you want on it, and I think. Okay. That means I have to change the header and the photo on each. Got it. Pages. Got it. I can turn this so I can do a CMS version if you like, one that you can do. there something that makes it easier to manage your content really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I’m not talking about, UI or anything like that. Okay. But yeah, also the intended audience. I think it’s the downside for this one is to say, we’re really about getting back to the web platform and learning stuff there. And partly because WordPress is. More popularly seen as a no code solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s really not fair when all the people are really serious developers who use WordPress, but generally it’s seen as that where our show is a bit about Pumping up a little bit how lovely and friendly code can be these days. Yeah. so it’s more suiting to that different audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Great. Yeah, so that’s that. also, let’s talk a bit about the static site generators. So there is, there do seem to be gaining popularity at the moment. So there was the. 2024 Web Almanac, which, was just so in showing that there’s a 67% growth in static and hybrid website. A, architectures amongst the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is difficult for me to say for some reason, 10,000 most visited sites. Gosh, that’s a lot. Wow. It’s, it is a huge growth. Yeah. I mean there is, there is, talk of it here, obviously Cloud Canyon, because they, do a CMS for static. People are obviously going to promote that. I think there is something, if you actually go to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itself, the way of being able to measure that’s quite tricky is particularly with something like Eleventy, because you can’t tell Eleventy is being used ‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; cause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Eleventy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:27] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t put anything out to identify itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. anybody interested in that would probably just want to go and look at, the table of contents and probably the jump stack area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because they’ve had to assess on the basis of speed. I believe how. what sites are statically generated and what’s are being dynamically. Okay. So it might not be entirely accurate, but Right. It does seem that there is a trend towards that. And obviously that’s where the growth has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s other static site generators like Astro 11 is fairly stable, but it’s still been growing over the years that it’s been around. So there is a general growth in those. So there is that, but there are some general problems. Shall we just quickly cover those? Yeah, problem. Let’s go for it. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. These are problems that WordPress solves for you, for other people, which is you do need some skills and you certainly need a willingness, I think, to use a terminal to do command line rather than a nice friendly ui. So that’s still something which is a bit alien to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think, a lot of people, that is already a bridge too far, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you Exactly. really getting the terminal out for. The vast majority of the people online is a, is too much. It’s immediately hostile and weird and too scary. So you’ve probably put 99% of the population out with that one bullet point, but for those 1% who love it and are willing to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Fair enough point taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and the interesting thing, having, I’m in that, it’s no, I’m not judging that, don’t do that. But now. because it’s a few simple commands and if it’s set out with instructions, how to do it. Yeah, it’s actually quite simple. it’s actually a lot simpler than dealing with most of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; ui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, are you in effect then memorizing the things that you need as opposed to having an understanding of, ever every single thing that you type? Is it more a set of, okay, this is now part of my muscle memory. I know that at this point I need to type this into the terminal even though I don’t fully understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the time, when it’s set up, all I’m ever doing is wanting to just run or serve at 11, which is just basically, I, you just do a run command. It’s that one command, and I’ve put it into a short key anyway, so it just, it’s, I don’t have to think to get it up and running. But of course when you’re installing all these different packages, which is what you do with these things, it’s, it’s all made possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why it’s popular now I think, is because we have. No js, which allows us to pull in all these packages and work on our local environment. So the idea of installing all these different packages and controlling those is, scary. It was scary to me. It’s still scary to me, but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so far, yeah, you never really see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you, you, you don’t quite get a visual. you get it in the terminal, you get some sort of. Text-based feedback that things have happened, but okay, where did those packages go? What just happened? Where is it on my computer? How can I get to it? And, of course the answer is you don’t really need to, anyway, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, okay. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, that’s, brilliant. It’s exactly my experience. and, but now, it’s starting to go, oh, it’s not that difficult at all actually. Yeah. And it just works anyway, and I know where it’s going. Yes. Yeah. I, it. It’s surprising how quickly you change and how it’s not as difficult as you first think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, yeah, and the other problem of course, with a static site generators is there are, so many choices out there. No industry standard. You can’t really look at this. If I just go over to the Jam Stack site here, we’ll see now on their filter here, it’s listing 365 different generators. Now, gosh, in all honesty, some of them you wouldn’t really think of as a site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I just go to this on license, we’ll see this WP two static, which is a, now I think defunct. I tried to use this actually a way of turning, a WordPress site into a static site. it maybe does work. It didn’t work the last time I tried it. You, have a solution to do that, don’t you? That you use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I’m not using that one, but I, have a plugin which enables me to turn static to turn WordPress websites into static, and then it shuffles it over to Netlify or. Bonnie, CDN or whatever, Amazon, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah. I, it may be listed on there. I don’t think it is, but, no. Yeah, there, there are some big players that everybody knows about because of the popularity of reactors, library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then next JS goes with that as a sort of static site generator for that. Hugh goes very popular because it’s quick, but it’s built on a language like go. And then we have all these other ones, which are perhaps. Declining in the popularity that were heavy, that were very much JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is one of those, popular ones coming forward now are Astro and stuff like this. The big, really what I’m trying to show here is the fact that there is so many choices, not one absolute leader in the area as there is with the dynamic with WordPress. And many of these will now be. Not broken, but they will not be getting the support that they need, Funding these things is, quite a tricky thing. So there, I think there are some downsides that go. if you move towards this static site generator, way many as retired as I’ve put here, but there’s also a lot to go into setting up a blog. Like we’re saying, all these different components that you make up in just your head or alone, we’re saying, oh, I want this image and this description to come in for Facebook, a different one for Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all of that kind of stuff. you’re gonna have to code all these different lines in, if you want the dates to do this, you have to do this if you are doing it manually. So there’s a lot of elements Yeah. that you have to do. And also, the big thing is that it’s the criticism, of setting site generators is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this benefit as well, but it’s cobbled together out of various bits of tech. it’s, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you said, it’s a house of cards. There’s this whole sort of, exactly that House of Cards, you remove one card halfway up the stack and many, more things collapse as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for our job, of course, the main thing is though, I don’t think it’s that relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted a, a ui, a CMS type UI for. Multi-author where we’re both adding to this, then that’s an extra complexity on top of the stuff that you have to do that. And there are, there is a free option. There’s dcap, which is great, which you could use, as a free CMS to do that. But otherwise they get quite expensive if you want to set them up and make ’em a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there’s no inbuilt comment, none of the dynamic stuff, of course, that you get on the service or the commenting system or the search. But then. I think that’s a topic. We could do a whole topic on this. What there are other solutions here. ’cause you could argue also on the WordPress side that things like caching make the commenting system difficult anyway and searches, and particularly I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good. Unless you do some work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, but it’s interesting ’cause they are all, they’re all parts of the thought process to going in, if you can’t tick all those boxes, it may be dynamic isn’t something that you wanna put on the shelf. Maybe dynamic is something that you want to do, WordPress and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if those things are things that you can cope with, particularly the second to last one, the multi-author bit. Yes. then yeah, go static and and. You’ve been through this process, and here’s the next bullet point, Why 11? That’s where you’ve settled? Yeah. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got 360 plus to choose from. Why that one? How did that make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; its way to the top? Exactly. I’ll just take one thing actually just on the commenting system. We’ll just go back on that one ’cause it maybe is worth talking about it. ’cause one thing that interests me and maybe the easier route, although it’s in WordPress as well, is to, I’m quite interested in web mentions and all of that indie stuff, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And how you could employ them on sites. But anyway, sorry. Why 11 two? So why really? Why have I. Move towards that. I guess it’s the people that I’ve been following recently. I’ve talked about that. mainly because let’s just go over to their site ’cause it says it all on there because it’s, pictures itself as the simpler static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s probably the easiest route in for somebody like me who doesn’t understand JavaScript. so that’s probably the key thing. Lemme just have a look. It’s un opinionated. Is that a proper word? Yeah, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; think so. Yeah. It does not have an opinion is on opinionated. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. In the sense that you’re not gonna know if 11 is being used unless declare it in some sort of way where even with the other static site generators, they’re probably likely to output something to help you along your way, which will give away that it is that particular static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s, I think it’s the only example I can think of that. Yeah, that’s really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting. ’cause yeah, you would’ve thought even to just promote the project, it would be, it’s a choice that they’ve made deliberately to have the ht ML or whatever is being surfaced on the front end. To deliberately strip out everything, which shows that it has been built with 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you think back to the origins of the project, that could have been a very sensible thing to put in because as the project grew, more people would, right click view source, ah, eleventy. Interesting. I’ll go and explore that. But they’ve made the decision to have none of that in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know that free marketing has gone away, but, for the benefit of the speed of the website and all of that, it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And, when we say they, it’s really one man. It’s leatherman. Yeah. Yeah. it’s been his project, which is, yeah, it’s just been that, his journey has been WordPress to jackal, to, creating eleventy as a version of jackal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do static site and he’s got these kind of things, which made me align with it, His approach to the web. okay. but it is very flexible because, lemme just go to their site again because it lists these, I think it does over here. no it doesn’t. let me go over to some of my other points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s used on a lot of well-known sites already,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh, no kidding. Look at that. Yeah. Nasa,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve got the W three C now. It’s used for various different pages. Yeah, it might be a sub domain of something, but still, yeah. WordPress is also used on nasa, so there’s overlap with this, where it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web dev, notify, lots and lots of different Chrome developers, so it’s got good. And it’s got really good people. That’s the main thing here. I’ve listed a few of ’em out, but I can see them here as people who contribute to it. Who, so I can see here, there’s, her name’s just gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miriam. Suzanne. There you go. Miriam, Suzanne. Yes. somebody writing that. I see Michelle Barker over here. I’m sure if I stared at this. Oh yes. I can see Stephanie Eccles. Lots of people here that we mention who are big fans of that. Let me go back to the notes here, ’cause I’m. Getting sidetracked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the other thing is as well, if you are using something like 11 T compared to say, another JAMstack solution, what it’s known for is its quick build times, which is quite important. So you’re building your end and you’re probably rooting it through to GitHub, which is then going on to something like gi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify. Yeah. And you, and there’s a cost to the build time on that. So if it takes a very long time, which something like Gatsby can take, 20 if not a hundred times longer than something like 11 t could to do similar number of pages. So it’s quite good on that if you want to stay within your free allowance, I’ve put it down as a benefit, that it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VC funded, venture capital is funded. Okay. But it’s also a negative I think, as well. Yeah, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; mean you’ve got that whole hit by a boss thing, haven’t you with it. if it’s one person, that means it’s great. You’ve got this one point of contact, but also you’ve got this one point of failure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; 11, it’s been quite interesting ’cause obviously it’s been this personal project, it’s taken off ’cause it’s met the needs of a lot of people who share his same view about keeping things as simple as possible, and and really taken off. With particularly people who, people like Miriam, Suzanne, people who contribute to, making CSS what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so it’s taken off, but Netlify funded it for some time. cloud Canyon did that because they were CMS. That’s use things like Astra and Eleventy or stuff like that. now I think to, it has been self-funded for some time, which is. Some of these people over here were some of the contributors to, they were paying their own money to use it to help him to put more time into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just recently, and I dunno what difference that’s gonna make to things, he’s just joined the font awesome team who are doing another product, which is, it’ll come to me in a minute. Something we can Okay. That’s Webber awesome. Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay. Oh yeah. I’d heard of that. Yeah, that’s gone out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve forgotten what that is. You saw that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Fantastic video. Yes. yeah. Yeah, that’s right. So yeah, so it’s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, it’s a part of that. That video was fantastic. That video was like, it was shot in Hollywood or something. That was incredible. Anyway, sorry, what an aside. Okay, moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and that’s it really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably just covered the. The main things were the things that came up in your mind about this? No,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the, I’m just curious to see because I, like I said, I haven’t used it. I’m a staunch WordPress fan, and I can, totally see why some of these things have got your, got your intuitions, you just wanna be out there and figuring out how all this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just keen to see how it works and in the end. How it works in terms of, being, let’s say a time saver. Now, I, know that there’s all the arguments about, okay, I don’t want a bloated CMSI don’t wanna pay for server time. That’s not being used. I don’t have a need for a commenting system and all that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m, interested to see how it saves time and money over time. I think they’re the two things that I wanna see from this, how quick is it to. Get up and running, how quick is it to create a page? How quick is it to, I don’t know, implement some of the designs like the bento one that you did recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How quick is it to inject those into it? and I’m fascinated by the cost implications. ’cause I imagine with this, the cost is for a typical, I don’t know, Brochure website for somebody living in a town, you know where there’s gonna be thousands of views a year, not millions of views a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested to see how close to free it is. ’cause I’m imagining it will approximate very close to free at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you, that’s what we’re doing at the moment, while we just do it with the basic web platform and no. Third party platform at all for this site. we check it out, we get our free hosting and I’m sure there’ll always be some free hosting for the sort of visits Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we get. The amount of traffic that we get. Yep. So really all this is building on the Y 11 to fits. It is because we can add in something to take, to remove some of the chore of having to update things that would. Come with WordPress out of the box. Yeah. there’s no doubt about it. If I was, taken on a job that, had a big, large content site and it needed multi authors and it was at my skill level, there’s no doubt it would be WordPress That would be the choice for this sort of thing if I had to do this job, because there’s no way that I would be linking all of this stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; To give them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:46] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; the UI that they needed. Yeah. yeah. so that would be the obvious choice. But when it comes to this, where. Effectively, it’s only you or I might have to update the content here. obviously the benefits of static is once you stick it up there, unless you mess with it, it’s gonna live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you put, like on a dynamic platform, someone else can mess up your website for You and you have to update, don’t you? Because you know you have to. Yeah. security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; patches, things like that. Yeah. It’s interesting. I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna be fascinating. I, you are gonna, you’re gonna ring WordPress out of my cold, dead hands, but, but nevertheless, it’s a fascinating ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I’m here to watch it all happen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Shall we, shall we do next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you could highlight what you think is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; gonna happen next time. Yeah. Okay. I think maybe we will try and we’ll take one of those, old sites. I’m not sure which ones. One of the, and I’ll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try and put some eleventy in it with my basic skills of what I know about it so far, so you can see it in action. I think we can probably do that as an audio as well, because Oh yeah, if I just explain Yeah. The process, I think it will make sense, but, we’ll definitely need YouTube so you can see what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we’ll give that a bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that sounds good to me. you’ll be able to check this out, at the No Script Show website. It’s no script show slash 15 ’cause that is the episode that we’re on. You’ll be able to find the show notes that we’re showing on the screen, but if you’re listening to it, on the audio, then there are some show notes there that you can click links on if any of the bits and pieces have raised your.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of curiosity, about 11 or indeed WordPress. So shall we call it a day? Is that a wrap? Yeah, I think so. Alright. See you. I’ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; thanks. Bye bye. Bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HTML and CSS not meeting the (perceived) component based design needs of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS not seen as easy to scope for large scale team project work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers not being trusted. Better to use JS to tell them what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing (although Meta and Google seem to have lost interest in their React and Angular offerings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amazing real time user interaction JavaScript brought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS frustrates many. Mostly through not learning it, understanding its declarative nature and impatience. &lt;strong&gt;Rachel Andrew wrote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;CSS is simultaneously too easy to bother with, yet so hard it needs to be wrapped up in a ball of JavaScript in case it scares the horses&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-getting-smaller&quot;&gt;Is it getting smaller?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS is being rapidly refactored - removing common dependencies on JS (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://astro-zerojs-transitions.vercel.app/&quot;&gt;interactive ones&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers working together to speed up progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web components offering a standards based interoperable alternative to 3rd party JS components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS fatigue. Maintaining a complex set of dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cascade is back with &lt;code&gt;@layer. @scope and :where()&lt;/code&gt; A move to doing more with less code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebAssembly (WASM) - a new web standard with more power than JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User demands:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For web content on their terms. Increasingly removing our visual designs and expecting content on any type of device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration with CSS often came from mimicking print.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need to deliver fast, green, valid and accessible HTML content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who use a WYSIWYG builder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More recently, those who develop themes as WordPress moves from PHP themes to JS block themes.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>What is the W3C doing about AI?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/13/" />
    <updated>2024-06-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/13/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-w3c-report&quot;&gt;The W3C Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s written as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/reports/ai-web-impact/&quot;&gt;academic paper&lt;/a&gt; and there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwLRtquaLOk&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on the W3C&#39;s YouTube channel. It&#39;s an open document that is first seeking community feedback via Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may lead to in-depth stakeholder interviews, W3C workshops and developing a standardisation roadmap. It&#39;s looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethical-and-societal-impacts&quot;&gt;Ethical and Societal Impacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency (data usage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy (protecting personal data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security (impersonation concerns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainability (the environmental impact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing interests (fairness to content creators and consumers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-impacts-and-standardization-proposals&quot;&gt;Technical Impacts and Standardization Proposals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consent mechanisms for Web content in AI training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of personal data stores for data control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labelling AI-generated content to combat misinformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposing model-backed Web APIs while maintaining interoperability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating the environmental impact of AI systems on the Web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting contributions on Github already. Some are questioning the threat AI poses to the Web. It does not link in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is another. Jacob Nielsen The &amp;quot;king of usability&amp;quot; thinks usability has failed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/accessibility-generative-ui&quot;&gt;Generative AI could do the job.&lt;/a&gt; Do we need alt tags and aria labels? Or language translation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tim-bernards-lee-ai-predictions&quot;&gt;Tim Bernards-Lee AI predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He think it will transform the way we interact with the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day we&#39;ll have AI assistants that work for us — similar to our doctors, lawyers, and bankers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The breakup of big tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His passion is for a web where users own their own data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software and skills. Today we’re talking about AI from the perspective of the W three C or the Worldwide Web Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping us with this is a new report from the W three C team called AI and the Web, understanding and Managing the impact of Machine Learning Models on the Web. Additionally, we have Tim Burners Lee AI predictions thanks to some recent comments when celebrating 35 years on the web. So David, this is a topic we both enjoy debating, so it’ll be interesting to see how our positions on AI have advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, over to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well have, we’ve been talking for about two hours before this. yes. We just couldn’t, yeah. Yeah. So we caught up on that. So we’ll try and stick, I think, as best as we can to what the W three C are saying because we can go off on so many tangents. And I think there’ll be other subjects here, won’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you my quick summary and I am in the position where I think I was excited about it and I still am. But I’ve never really bought into the fact that it’s something creative, going to threaten any creative job that I might do. I quite like how the large language machines are helping me to do some really tedious tasks these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do think it’s quite interesting ’cause it feels a little bit like we’ve moved away from that and initial hype where we are more panicked about it and we’re seeing more. Of the kind of news where companies are feeling forced a little bit to exaggerate what you can do. We’re seeing more about how it might be so much more costly to make it advance in the way that we expect it to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, so it’s quite interesting since the last time we spoke about there was more sort of panic over it, where it feels a bit more relaxed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I, flip flop on this subject. I go from a deep admiration of AI and the things that it can do to blind panic, like chicken little, the sky is falling in. And I, really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I think, the reason is because in some areas where I honestly thought, computers, let’s call it that computers could never encroach. So the creation of artwork or the creation of songs, that kind of thing. I really did think five years ago that wouldn’t be an impossibility. There was something about the human brain, which was unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then more recently when things. Which you could call art and things, which we could call music came along. It really did start to make me think, gosh, okay, this is, this is a worry. And I think the worry for me is that we’re gonna gouge out the bottom rung of the ladder. If you imagine a ladder, a career ladder if you like, and, you need people to get on the first step of the ladder in order to then progress to other things as their career goes on and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it feels like AI has the potential to just knock out the first. Bottom two steps of the ladder because it can approximate, a, decent song, it can approximate a decent logo or whatever it might be. And so I worry that the people who might have had those jobs and therefore gained experience, they’re gonna somehow have to get above what the AI can do to be useful in a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that worries me. But then equally, I think over the last year, I’m feeling this sense of plateau in what the ais can do. it doesn’t really seem like what it could do a year ago. Is that different from what it can do now? And I expected that would be logarithmic. It would just improve at a greater rate, whereas it seems to have plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other thing is with technology since let’s say the turn of the millennium, so 2000, you didn’t really know what the intention was. You didn’t really have a roadmap in your head of what the internet ought to be like. It just evolved. Where whereas with ai, you can perceive what that is and that is a replacement of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you can get an ai, AI to create a perfect film, a perfect song. you know what that is already. Whereas the internet, I don’t know what that is. I never knew what it was gonna be. So anyway, so I think on balance, I’m more sanguine about it. and certainly every time I’ve used AI for the tiny little corner of the, the AI possibilities that I use it for, I’ve been profoundly impressed by what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I have this notion in my head, which is probably self-deception in a way, because I would’ve been doing all of that work myself, and I’m not therefore doing somebody out of work. I’m just saving myself some time. I. I feel that’s a decent trade off, but obviously if that were played out across the whole world, that might not be quite such a, good endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sorry that was a complete rant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, it’s fine. actually there’s just, you made me think of something we didn’t even talk about before, but I think, when it might cut out that bottom layer, the fundamentals. That funny enough is where I think it fails because I think, where it’s pretty rubbish at doing stuff is like things like marking out some HML, which might be appropriate to the context it needs to be, or it’s terrible with CSS I’ve found, and I think, sometimes when it might take some of the chore out things that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;absolutely known, I used it for WordPress. Really impressive because if you like the PHP commands that you might use, the old ones for traditional WordPress are so set that there’s not much variation. So ask it to do something which I couldn’t do. It could do the code, which I couldn’t do, but I know it’s going to be correct, because there’s only so many outputs where I think, sometimes the fundamental structuring of a website or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it just doesn’t do it. And it’s same because it’s always looking backwards on its stuff. CSS has evolved particularly so it doesn’t know the new stuff and it looks back to the majority of the old stuff, which is not the best way to do it. So, I find actually in some ways it’s, I’m going back to the basics of the very early web and trying to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get to understand things, which I thought I knew, but don’t. HDML and CSS particularly as it’s changing and I think it’s so bad at those things that, yeah, it, you know, I have to guide it on the fundamentals. So I, that is my worry actually with AI is that sometimes it can be used to fill in what you think is a good example for me is AI with, I was talking about this, I did a short video AI with, ALT tags for images seems to be a new thing to do that. And you think, yeah, that’s great. But if you think about it for one second, the last thing a blind person wants is, all this wonderful prose on what this image looks like. They want to know what a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; game changing, whatever. Yeah, just over superlative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, but you remind me the whole No, what I’m saying is that, if you really describe a full image as a I Oh, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; see. Yes. It won’t know when how to truncate itself or, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. Actually what that image is doing, it wants to know what that image is doing, what parts of that image are. Are meaningful to the context in which it’s set right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest is all superfluous. Yeah. So do you see what I mean? I can see where, it’s these lower level things, some of these other jobs where I think you actually have to be a human being because you’re providing for other human beings anyway. Yeah. We’ve, no,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; no, but that’s interesting. And I, do wonder, I wonder particularly in the, with the example of CSS, because the CSS isn’t the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is what the CSS. Does, which is visual. Yes. I wonder if, that, if the, AI at the moment, these large language models, I wonder if they can make the connection, okay, here’s some code. But what does that actually end up looking is the point, and it might not be able to make bridge that gap, if Yeah. So maybe it’s, maybe that’s, I don’t know. I’m entirely ignorant of whether that’s even a thing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; but Yeah. And for speed, I want it to be fast and in the context of the whole site, and it just can’t do it, and I just avoid it because, it just starts hallucinating as. AI does when I start, it doesn’t know stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It thinks it does, and, it, I love sending it off for down its hallucinations where it believes it’s right and it’s completely wrong, and then like to enjoy watching. But, other stuff, it’s great when, when I think when you are making the creative decisions, treating it as a. A dumb assistant I think is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we bring up the notes? Because honestly we’ll just go on. Yeah, I will do that completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; One moment. Here we go. This is the note. if you are listening to this. Let me get the number right. ’cause in the past I’ve got the numbers of the episodes wrong. So we’re on episode number 13 1 3. And so if you go to no script show slash 13 1 3, you’ll be able to find these show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have, I’ve got the episode right for a start. Yes. You have lucky for everyone. Yeah. Okay, great. So here we are. What, where should we launch first? Yeah, this W three C report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I just thought this was a good chance ’cause it’s, recently out and it’s, obviously it, the title doesn’t really beg it to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an academic paper. And, there is a presentation. I’ve got a link on the show notes, which goes to the YouTube, channel there. But the guy behind that, it’s maybe not, he’s, French, so if, if you can tune into his accent, you might find it quite interesting as a quick sort of summary of what they’re trying to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my understanding is. it comes from the W three. See team, is that what they call themselves? Yeah. Yeah. And it’s, that’s really the, they’ve got about, I think 46 employees in that team. And, this is really just a first document out there, which might later form standards. So the idea is that they put this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment it’s public, so it welcomes feedback. So it’s out on GitHub, so you can, if you think this report is missing something they should be looking into, you can add to it. And we’ll talk about that, but, We’ve got a summary. Do you wanna just run through these, Nathan? We’ve got, I’ve tried to divide it up what the report is saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. just to read what’s on the screen, really, ethical and societal. Societal is hard to say. Impacts, are transparency, data usage. These, some of them have got little parentheses at the end, privacy, which is protecting personal data security, impersonation concerns. Sustainability, the environmental side of sustainability, balancing interests, and that really refers to the fairness to the content creators and the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m sure that if you ponder each of those for just a moment, you can see in a real world example of where AI might be able to abuse. Any of those individual bits, obviously sustainability. If we all rely on AI for everything, we’re gonna be burning through carbon at an incredibly quick rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balancing interests do content creators, who, owns what if the LLMs are allowed to sock up all of the data without giving credit back, and, they appear to be the origin. Of that particular piece of content, whereas in fact it was written by somebody, I don’t know, 10 years ago or what have you, and each of them, just ponder it for a moment and you’ll be able to figure out how that might be of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And then I think the next, because it’s sectioned up and the next thing is really addressing those ’cause it’s the technical impact and standardization proposal. So obviously what the W three C as a standards organization for the web, it likes to ultimately come up with some standards, which we all agree to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s really addressing all of the next ones with, a sort of consent mechanism for AI content. In AI training development of personal data stores for data control, labeling of AI generated content to combat misinformation exposure, sorry, exposing model. Backed web IPAs while maintaining interoperability and evaluating the environmental impact of AI systems on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just say the, I do like the idea of a web, IPA, which is what you’ve actually said. A, web-based Indian pale ale. That would be, really nice. I think you meant to say API, but I prefer I did. I prefer what you said. Can I just say though, just getting back before you put this document together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I didn’t really know anything about this at all, and I honestly didn’t think this was any concern. I. Of the W three CI, I couldn’t in my head, have imagine, why do they, wanna get involved with this? and then of course when you put this together and I started thinking about it, really, somebody’s got to be thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s really where it comes down because it has to be some sort of more global approach, an approach where big business doesn’t get its tendrils where government doesn’t necessarily get its tendrils. And All of a sudden the penny dropped. And I thought, actually, yeah, this is brilliant. We do need people who are detached from it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they have no economic motive, no political motive, whatever it may be. it’s brilliant that they’re thinking about this and, they seem like fairly sensible defaults starting positions. Yeah. yeah. Anyway, sorry. You carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I, had the same thought as well. It’s trying to understand what the W three C has, and I think it does have a unique power when we’ve talked about before with, the working groups, particularly with CSS, how, within those working groups, it’s bringing to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big tech. It’s bringing Microsoft, apple, Google, Adobe to agree what they think the web should look like, these standards. So it’s obviously the best body given that AI pretty much appears through the web. What other organization could get everybody around the table? And you can see we were talking about this a little bit earlier about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How there might be a benefit to say Google because its main business is through its advertising, through its search. particularly that’s its main business. One of its biggest worries and one of the things they’re tackling here is how do we mark up on the web stuff so people know it’s AI generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, Google want that more than anything for their own business, as well as being on the side of. Supplying AI as well. They also want to control that for that aspect of their business. So there’s a good reason for everybody to try and agree things, I think, to some standards. So where is expected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VER developers, who when we’re putting sites together that we declare our. AI content, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think it’s gonna be really difficult for the W three C to have teeth in this, in that it’ll be easier for them to just create some recommendations, which we, we would hope people would follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe this will be one of those situations. So for example, at the moment. It does appear that accessibility. So nothing to do with AI for a moment, just accessibility is gaining teeth because politicians around the world are, putting laws together, which say, look, unless you do this, you are gonna feel the, strong arm of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if your website is not accessible in these certain ways. And here’s the guide, here’s the guidance for how that should look. but now we’re gonna give it teeth. And that’s coming around in next year in the eu. Maybe this sort of stuff over time will need that approach as well, because you can imagine it’ll be easy to just ignore any of those points and just say, yeah, nice idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my country, the jurisdiction that I live in, doesn’t compel me to do it, so I’m not gonna do it. Yeah, I’m gonna steal that content and claim it as my own. Who cares? so we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the idea of this report is that it does, it is the first stage in it, so right at the moment it’s out there as a, partly written document where people can add in their views and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be, and there’s a couple of ’em will come onto that minute, so this, but then they’ll move on to stakeholder interviews, which I guess we’ll be talking to the likes of Google. Yeah. Microsoft and what they’re doing on that, and then it’ll move into the. W three C workshops in the way that they might go about standardizing anything like CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. But I think, surely it should be welcomed by, when you think that you might have Microsoft competing with Google over, I’m sure everybody wants this to be a success in, The end. So if everybody can agree some standards of which they will work to on the web, then it’s to the benefit of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that’s where they are unique. But yeah, it does seem a little odd to me. when, ’cause most of our news about AI is not really, you think of it as a separate endeavor and one which potentially. And that’s another argument of it could remove the need for the web entirely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. You’re imagining a scenario where you’ve just got this little pocket assistant or something, and a lot of the things that you’re doing on the web, you’ve now consigned to this ai, which is sitting in a device in your pocket or something like that. And you don’t need to browse webpages because I don’t know, you just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask it a question and it provides you with an answer. Yeah. It undermines what the internet has become. Yeah. This is, honestly, this is so interesting. I with those ethical and societal impacts, I’m, I can’t think of anything that they’ve missed, but I’m sure that you’re right. As the days, weeks, and months go on, I’m sure there’ll be other things thrown in there, but at the moment we do seem to be in a cycle of hype, and I’m seeing it more like that as a cycle a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulfilling prophecy, if you like, where one AI company promises a thing. And so the other AI companies have to over promise because of that promise. And then, the original one then has to over promise. And we do seem to be in an ear at the moment and you only have to watch the tech conferences, Google’s io and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they portray AI being this entirely benign. Perfect force where you, are, you show it a thing and it tells you what it is, and you ask it a question and it gives you the right answer. And, it does really seem the hype cycle that we might have had for things like crypto or NFTs a little while ago, and, maybe give it a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That cycle will just, people will realize. You know what? It can’t do everything for me, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I mean there’s certainly, that’s cynical. We’ve been watching some videos that have come out, by, business people who will just say this whole AI thing is exactly like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s another thing. It was big data before that. It’s been, wearables, it’s been Bitcoin, it’s been, and this is just another, Raising funds. Silicon Valley hype hoax if you like. and certainly I think people have been caught into, as we know with Google, it cheated, and got found out for showing some of its demonstrations of what its AI can do where, it’s supposed to be able to identify certain shapes and tell you exactly where it was, where it needed human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we had a big thing with Amazon as well, where they claim it was a success, but it needed all of these. operatives in India creating the, it was a checkout for their store where they didn’t need to go and purchase anything but cameras with, real people were doing it. And now they claim the a l was a success, but they still closed it down and they still removed a lot of their documentation before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there’s a certain element where I’m sure none of these companies wanting to get into this kind of, almost having to get into lives if you like to compete. Yeah. Somebody starts it with an exaggeration, somebody else has to beat it because we’re in competition and they get stuck in it, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think one could, one could gently call it overpromising,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; overpromising is probably a better thing. Yeah. But I don’t think it’s, it’s probably not where any of these companies want to be. It’s just the way, that’s just the way I. Capitalism works, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everybody, you have to try and get the best competitive advantage. So I would imagine, the WCC has that ability in the past to agree, and I think we’ve only just seen that with a web where everybody agrees. Yes, the web, we want a standard set of code and we all want to agree what that one is, and we all want to make the web work on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I, I can see how it can be a good place. For AI to be there. Yeah. But there is an argument, sorry, I wanted to just say something on that is I think it’s alluded to in somebody’s GitHub, addition to this, and I think it was that you could say it’s a threat to the web itself in the sense that, and I’ve seen other people talk about this, so if you say, for example, PDFs, they’re very difficult because they’re not web right to make accessible and you have to put all this embedded stuff in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they’re saying these days is that. large language machines can read that stuff and work out how the content is. So that work might not need to be done in a way. And we see that a little bit, I think with a lot of SEOs saying about Google, how when we were in the age of the big data mark, everything up with schema.org or rich snippets that they called, it was the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it up. But a lot of SEOs are saying, and it’s true of Google. They seem to be dropping the support for a lot of these things. Partly because it might be over abused, but I think it’s partly because they don’t need it so much because the machines can work out the content areas of sites based on Oh, I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their knowledge. Okay. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, yeah, some, things which, so you can get into that argument where you’re saying, a lot of the fundamentals of the webs, which we agreed to, do we need them in the same way? Do we need, old tags any longer? if they’re being read in a different way with AI and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do we need aria labels and stuff? If screen readers can detect themselves, with new technology, what a page markup is, yeah, it’s quite interesting. There is a, potential for some of the web to be undermined. with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I was gonna say something there, but I’ll wait because it is what we’re gonna come onto, but it was about the capacity of AI to actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get all of that stuff right. the dom and what have you. So shall I just scroll up a little bit more and, We’ll go onto the next little bit. okay. So we’re onto Jacob Nielsen, did you wanna mention him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, was just somebody else made the point that, in that report isn’t talking about accessibility and Jacob Nielsen, the king of usability is called Think he wrote an article, and I’ve linked to it there, that usability has failed. People don’t use their RRE labels correctly, don’t mark their HTML up in the way that screen readers can easily read them. And that generative AI could start to do that job, which is really the point I’m making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that was the point I was gonna make as well. And, I think, that kind of makes sense. Wouldn’t this be an area where AI would be. Very good because it’s got a very defined outcome, Ha. Has it been marked up correctly for a screen reader, ignoring the fact that in the future screen readers might operate in a different way for the screen readers that we’ve got today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would AI be potentially quite good at this? Because it could see, I don’t know. This is a paragraph, this is a heading that is as heading, nested within another heading. Let’s give that an H two and that an H three and whatever else we might add to the HTML, the markup. It feels like that would be an area where you could just maybe click a button and it would do a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better job than you not doing it at all, if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think that’s, I, see Jacob Nielson’s point and I see he’s had some pushback by a lot of people, disabled people actually. and I understand that pushback, and I think this is where, I don’t think that’s the right thinking because I think you do need people to markup because you need another human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking this up to make sense to human. admittedly, it’s better than nothing, but I don’t think it’ll get rid of the idea that marking up. documents with HTML properly, with a concentration on accessibility. And I think in some ways it’s, skipping the point as you raised the fact that next year we’ve got a European law, which is requiring many of us to do our websites in a more accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it’s right in the fact that it’s failed, but then there’s been nobody policing this. And I think we’re seeing more policing of it. And I think human beings marking up documents rather than letting. AI do it is better because they will mark it up with the context of how it’s expected to be explained in the same way that I said about alt text as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s no point in describing the whole flipping thing. It’s really how that image relates. does it relate at all? If not, it needs a blank and don’t read it out to people who don’t need to know it. Yeah. it’s just decorative and I don’t think AI can then distinguish that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so it, the AI might be better than doing nothing at all. But it’s probably not gonna be as good as doing something with humans, if I think that’s a sensible default position. Yeah. if your organization is gonna do something, it would appear that just clicking a button and praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the AI didn’t hallucinate its way into just nonsense is probably not gonna get you out of legal woes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then we’ve got Tim burners Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So he’s been, because he’s been the 35th anniversary of the web. Yeah. Gosh. I know it’s getting old. yeah. so yeah, he’s made a, it’s, there’s a couple of things and I’ve linked to them on the bottom of this and maybe I’ll add some more links in ’cause we referenced some things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, so he’s done an open letter. About the web, which talks about that. But also there’s another article which is, by CNBC, where they’re going to some of his predictions and included in that is, is AI or as I’m seeing on my notes, it says A one. Yeah, A road in the uk there’s gonna be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. So the big takeaways from this I’ve added to that was the fact that he thinks it’s gonna transform the way we interact with the web. And Google interestingly have been like that as well recently saying, let you know, let Google do the Googling for you. I. This is new take on what we expect the deal to be with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, he’s saying that’ll transform how we inter interact and he sees I’m not so optimistic as him that we’ll all have AI assistance do work for, similar to how our doctors, lawyers, or bankers do. So. he’s very optimistic, isn’t he? About AI more so than me and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; What, do, you know what, that almost to me sounds like a bit of a dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s a film that I watch and it’s got nothing to do with this, but there was a film that I watched recently where, and it was a dystopian future film, but there was a bit where, the, protagonist, the character in the film went up and talked to a robot to get his prescription. And, there was an actual robot, which, it had a flat lights flashing on the mouth, but no other moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it was just this, horrific conversation of, I’m owed this thing, can I have it? we don’t seem to have this for, really robotic voice. Anyway, back and forth, and just nothing but frustration. And I, that concerns me, that piece because that seems to undermine the humanity of a lot of things and that bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That be okay. Maybe that’s where we’ll go. But it, I fear that’s where we’re gonna go. It, that doesn’t seem like a, good incentive for humanity particularly, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, a lot of, services we have is because of that personal connection with people, it. Almost acting like counseling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lot of people grieve over the loss of that human connection, their trans actions. So yeah, I think he’s a little bit more optimistic, than I would be. He does also, and it’s related, it’s not under his AI predictions, but he is, predicting as he wrote in his open ledger as well about breakup of big tech as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sees that happening and I. this is the problem, isn’t it? We are in an advanced capitalist world and we are seeing that, money is going to, concentrated in certain areas. We have big tech, they have an awful lot of power, and we are seeing, To getting to the point where we have to see the US government will be taking a lawsuit out against Apple to make sure this competition there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got something new that’s just passed, doesn’t it, for the EU as well, which gives more control over big tech so it doesn’t abuse its position. So I do think there may be a need to Yeah, you, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And also interestingly, it is largely. Big tech. Which is pushing this agenda of what AI can do. there, there’s no like tin pot, little cottage industry mom and pop AI out there, which is, a good rival to something like open AI or Gemini or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big tech who are, and we mentioned it a moment ago, this self-fulfilling prophecy where they’ve got to overpromise because the other one’s overpromising and it’s the big tech doing it, and they’ve got a really big stage. And honestly, they could fill those, they could fill those presentations with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utter lies. And I think at the moment we just lap it all up because, oh, look, it can do that. That’s exciting. yeah, so I, yeah, I, think you’re right. It does appear like the legislators around the world are, have got the, sword of Damocles definitely above the heads of these big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ll see how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Governments having to take a part in this just to see that. Yeah. They don’t have too much power. And, we were talking about, how interesting it is with. Gen Z seeing things very different. Being a kind of first generation that doesn’t have job security and housing insecurity, that they are slightly cynical where, big companies where money’s going on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they change their behavior with big tech. They see in a way what’s going on, where, who has all the power with that. So I think that’s changing things on the ground. I do think, with Tim Burnley and he always sticks to this ’cause it’s partly as well, I think a business that is running is big on everything where this has to be set in the context of the fact that is ideal Web is one where the users own their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I’m a. A big proponent of that. But it’d be interesting because it would appear that some of the big tech companies, particularly Apple, it would appear that they’re moving in that direction. In that they’re it feels that although they have just. Been in chat with open AI apparently, so we’ll see if this breaks out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, is that the, AI will be done on your device, these M four chips that are coming down the pipe will be really good at doing everything on your own device. So as whereas at the moment you’re used to going to open AI or Gemini, and that’s an online. Portal, you type your things in and whether you’re using the API or the web interface, you get a result through the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It, feels like the future is gonna be doing that on your own device. So you own it and it never goes anywhere else. So maybe, Apple will justify not being broken up on that ground. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you mentioned something about there’s no, mom and pop, AI business there. It, we both watched a video, which we liked in a way, but, it was, it was on YouTube and it’s guy called Mike Pound and it’s on, it’s channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll put the link in ’cause I haven’t got it there. Okay. computer file. And this was the one, if you remember, Nathan, where he was looking at some of the scientific report. And we’re, always talking about the massive advance. Yeah. In AI and what it can do within a whole year, but all their reports or what he was looking at, we have to trust him that his reports are there, but he seemed to be sound man talking, saying that progress will slow down because the costs of getting the quality, because it’s so easy to gather a load of data and that not to be that great, which it means everything’s always looking back, but like I say, it’s rubbish with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS because there’s so little data about modern CSS and everything’s old. So to correct it you need so much more data to keep throwing at it, that the costs become too much, in terms of the businesses too advance, it becomes too much. To invest in it, to be able to get the improvements back. And then that’s the other debate, which we’ve heard a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I, you mentioned it on, your new show, about the environmental cost of AI with all of that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh boy, that’s just terrific. Yeah, I think, if you think. Googling things is bad if you, AI things, if you request an answer from an ai, you really are burning through the carbon much more quickly than just going onto a variety of websites and finding it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it’s a lot quicker, but every time you create an AI image or an AI song, or do an AI search. My understanding is that, from journalists that I think have credibility that it’s, burning through CO2, a really alarming rate and something which really shouldn’t be sustainable. so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That’s interesting. I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it does seem like there’s a little bit of a or a weariness now that this will actually pan out. like all the things, as mentioned before, the kind of Silicon Valley stuff, that’s the big thing that’s gonna make money. there’s a lot of other people as well saying, this potentially could be another.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bust,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. if it doesn’t continue to get better at an exponential rate, we’ll quickly grow tired of it. ’cause that’s the human condition, isn’t it? Yeah. And the YouTube video, which you are gonna link to but isn’t on the screen at the moment, it ha I think you did a really credible job of explaining that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, rather than the graph going upwards, it, went up for a long time because the LLM suddenly enabled things, which were not possible. And so it looked like. It was being creative and it looked like it was human almost, and it looked like it was passing the Turing test, but his, argument was that, okay, you had to consume all the data to get to that point, and then to make it twice as good as it is now is not just about putting double the amount of data in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re like a thousand times the amount of data. To get a teeny tiny improvement. So you put another billion point data points in and you get N point, N 0.1 of a percent improvement. You gotta add another 10 billion. And where does it all come from? yeah, and if we end up filling it in with AI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we’re in trouble. But it, made me more sanguine about it, it’s leveling off and potentially it won’t get any better. Obviously, we’re recording this in June, 2024 when the robots have taken over in August, 2025. we’ll have to revise this podcast,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I do think, but it takes us full circle with all the things we’re talking, which, I think when we look at the ethical and societal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact and, the things that they’re trying to standardize. It touches on all of these things, the sort of data usage, what data you are using over this. if everybody’s agreed to certain things, we’ll have proper competition rather than, do you know what I mean? Yeah. There’ll be more honesty with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I think also, something that’s not being resolved yet is the. the content creators, it’s stealing all of their work and, I think some people have done some experiments with, because it’s such a small data set, if you get into something very niche and you ask ai, it, it will almost duplicate what sort of Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; More or less you are robbing quite literally the exact Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, and some people have done some experiments where they’ve done it on something so niche or E even tested it by putting up wrong information on the web so the AI comes back with the wrong information that is on the web because it’s the only source, but it almost entirely rips off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole article that serves it back. So I think, when it comes to standardizing some of this stuff, when it starts to look into, the fairness of to content creators in some standards, and it looks to, I. the kind of data usage and it looks to what’s sustainable as well. I really hope that AI do get round the table around this, kind of things to create standards because I, it’s not in their interest, I don’t think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think AI’s promising. I think it can help us to do a lot of jobs and we both use it and love. Some of the things it can do for us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but it’s interesting though, but it, okay. So all of these organizations are made up of humans and Yeah, it is in their interest to not do this in the short term because there, there’s gonna be billionaires made there next year, and then they can just swan off and do whatever else they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the long term interest, if open AI and Google want to have an a, an AI future. That spans decades then, there is an interest. But I think one of the things that I’m concerned about at the moment is the self-interest. Yeah. Of a few people at the top of these companies who are, making money, like they’re printing it and it is in their interest to just do the nefarious stuff, to over promise to all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we, don’t seem to have a way of. Reigning those people in at the moment. That could be a very naive position. Maybe they’re full of, good intentions and I’m probably, I’m labeling them incorrectly, but it feels a bit like that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, of course. And it’s gonna happen. And I, for me, I think why I think this is good organization and I hope it does succeeded with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’cause I think, yeah. We talked about another success before when you think the web could have been lost to flash. Proprietary technology, Yeah. That could have easily, and a lot of people believed in it. It would be in the self-interest, but somehow it managed to preserve, and I think there’s never been a time where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest giants in tech I’ve got behind something like the W three C. So we see the security of this web project, and I don’t, I was saying about before, could it replace the web? I don’t think it will because it takes so long anyway for people to adopt new technology and it’s more effective the one that we’ve got and everybody is behind that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. They’re setting up of these. So I think it would be a good thing. And even if there is a lone wolf out there who, perhaps wants to exaggerate for their personal quick gain or something. ’cause that’s the danger, isn’t it? With everything. Somebody tells a lie to exaggerate something, they do really well out of that lie because people believe it and they get lots of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next, the only way you can compete it is with another lie and on it goes and everybody goes. Please. I wish we’d stop with this lying, and I think that’s right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, dear. I mean we’ve definitely, we’ve definitely solved that problem for everybody, haven’t we? Yeah, They’ve solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody. I,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s interesting anyway, and, just hardly going to get any attention, the fact that there is this document out there and I think, I think it’d be interesting to see how that develops and whether we get, yeah. AI standards coming from the W three C, I think that would be a fabulous thing if it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfect. I’ve taken the show notes away. so that was episode 13. That was our thoughts on, AI and the W three C’s approach to it. the show notes as always, no script show slash the episode number in this case. 13. Go and check ’em out there and, you two will be able to see Tim Burn’s Lee’s predictions as to what will happen to the A one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt it. I’m sure David will go and change that in a hurry, but that was lovely. Thank you David. Thanks. I’ll speak to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, cheers. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;responsive-typography&quot;&gt;Responsive typography&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve gone from one screen resolution to accommodating standard mobile and tablet sizes to no assumptions about viewport size or pixel density.  We&#39;ve seen various shifts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;px to rems.&lt;/strong&gt;  Once hotly debated. The 62.5% trick of converting 1 rem to 10 px is still quite popular.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media queries to fluid typography&lt;/strong&gt; (with viewport units and calc). Recommended: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://utopia.fyi/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Utopia CSS generator&lt;/a&gt; and Trys Mudford&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6wSHqGreQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;video presentation&lt;/a&gt; about Utopia and fluid design. Utopia also helps us with type scale.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individually spaced elements to systems for flow (vertical stacking)&lt;/strong&gt;. Recommended: &lt;a href=&quot;https://every-layout.dev/layouts/stack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The stack on Every Layout&lt;/a&gt;  and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://someantics.dev/great-typography-with-modern-css/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;typography demo&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Mai on Ben Myer&#39;s someantics.dev.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New units:&lt;/strong&gt; ch, ex, vw, vh, vmin and vmax. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seem an increased awareness that the web should be readable to all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a western bias to writing modes and internationalisation.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/3&quot;&gt;We talk about this&lt;/a&gt; when discussing a talk by Rachel Andrew on modern CSS layout.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web safe fonts to an abundance of open source options and back to quality and system fonts.&lt;/strong&gt; We did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/3&quot;&gt;short video &lt;/a&gt;on system fonts which looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernfontstacks.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;modernfontstacks.com.&lt;/a&gt;  Familiarity help users the most, but designers like new trends. We have to find a balance.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the browser styles to setting line height and proximity according to the font used&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;abbr title=&quot;The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&quot;&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt; can give us some guidelines (ie. 1.5 for paragraph line heights). Experts set this according to the font&#39;s &quot;X&quot; size. They know also to reduce the line height on headings and make the space above a heading wider the the space to the next paragraph for better proximity. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From seeing link underlining as &quot;visual clutter&quot; to respecting it as essential UI&lt;/strong&gt;. We now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;text underlining offset &lt;/a&gt;, text-decoration thickness and style giving designers more control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;variable-fonts&quot;&gt;Variable Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Multiple font formats (TTF, OFT, EOT, WOFF) to WOFF2 (unless supporting IE).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Individually loading weights and italics to fine control via CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Color (chromatic) fonts. It is probably too soon to see the value particularly as this has not started with one format.
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;wide&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesser-used-specifications&quot;&gt;Lesser used specifications&lt;/h2&gt;   
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
There&#39;s lots in HTML and CSS that is probably under-used in typography.  Here we are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CSS columns&lt;/a&gt; to force two columns within the space available. We could set it to &lt;code&gt;columns: 2;&lt;/code&gt; but we would need a media query for smaller devices. Instead this set to &lt;code&gt;columns: 18rem auto;&lt;/code&gt; so when there is not 18rem of space it colapses to one column.    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the above section we are using &lt;code&gt;:first-letter&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;initial-letter: 1.5&lt;/code&gt; to create a drop cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; On this site the &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag saves us needing images to explain keyboard commands &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;  &lt;kbd&gt;⇧ Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;Enter ↵ &lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s many other useful tags in HTML. In this article we have used: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;abbr title=&amp;quot;Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WCAG&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;wbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to force the Typograpy title to break as &quot;typo&quot; and &quot;graphy&quot; when ther is not enough space. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-specifications&quot;&gt;New specifications &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hanging-punctuation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hanging-punctuation&lt;/a&gt; It gives us the ability to have stop quotation marks indenting the text. Safari only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;font-size-adjust&lt;/a&gt;Most useful for ajusting fallback fonts to match custom fonts. Preventing a jump. Limited availability &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-kerning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;font-kerning &lt;/a&gt; sets the use of the kerning information stored in a font. Auto lets the browser decide. Normal let the font decide. Fully supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-clip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;background-clip &lt;/a&gt; sets whether an element&#39;s background extends underneath its border box, padding box, or content box. Used on the title of this post. Widely Available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers have got ever more creative with text and the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Worldwide Web Consoritum&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt; is making it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll animation coming to CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing modes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better positioning with CSS grid and subgrid.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;                 
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to the No Script show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#8217;re talking about how web typography has evolved to meet new technological and social demands. We can&amp;#8217;t cover all the new CSS properties and units or fully explore what is possible with variable fonts, but we might be able to understand modern web typography through its changing history. David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How comfortable are you with the topic of typography? Now there&amp;#8217;s a leading question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:37] David Waumsley: Yeah. not very, I always feel intimidated. We were talking about this earlier. I think we both feel that when people really know their stuff, when they&amp;#8217;ve got design training, they know stuff and it&amp;#8217;s almost a secret language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#8217;s a club. Yep. I dunno the secret handshake to get in, but I&amp;#8217;m learning stuff and it&amp;#8217;s becoming more important to me all the time and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;think it never felt at the beginning when I was doing websites, it never felt like an important thing. And then I&amp;#8217;d open up a book. So when books were the way that you learn about the internet, I&amp;#8217;d open up a book and I&amp;#8217;d see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;somebody getting into typography and my eyes would just glaze over. there&amp;#8217;d be charts pointing to the corners of letters and the kerning and all of that kind of thing. And I think I don&amp;#8217;t need to know any of this. it&amp;#8217;s hard enough getting the pixels on the page, just I&amp;#8217;ll use whatever font comes my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you&amp;#8217;re right. And I, feel like a lot of people who have been, very good, capable, thoughtful about typography, I. Maybe they have some background in graphic design, a history of working in graphic design, or maybe they went to some art college or something like that. So there has been a feeling that it&amp;#8217;s in a domain that I don&amp;#8217;t, usually circulate in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:53] David Waumsley: I know. And you were showing me some of the books that were on your shelf there. Yeah. You&amp;#8217;ve got things by Elliot J Stock and, what was it? Mark Bolton. Mark Bolton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;The, the Designing for the Web, it&amp;#8217;s an old book now, but open it up and it&amp;#8217;s full of this typography stuff and, actually interestingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that information in that book has probably aged. If you were to look at screenshots of websites, that will be terribly outta date. &amp;#8217;cause that book&amp;#8217;s probably about 12, maybe older, maybe as much as 15 years old, I&amp;#8217;m not sure. the, layouts and the capabilities and the screenshots of the websites, they&amp;#8217;re really out of date now and you almost smirk looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the typography information. It looks as fresh today as it ever did. So that&amp;#8217;s curious. It&amp;#8217;s this stuff is old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:40] David Waumsley: Yeah. And I think what we&amp;#8217;re talking about is how we&amp;#8217;ve translated some of that historically onto the web here. We&amp;#8217;ve not worried about it &amp;#8217;cause we&amp;#8217;ve been limited in what we could do When we started with the web, when we started, we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You had those website fonts anyway, but, but I, and I think there&amp;#8217;s also errors that we&amp;#8217;ve never even thought of that you and I both been exposed to you particularly &amp;#8217;cause you&amp;#8217;ve interviewed a lot of people who are knowledgeable about this. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot of things like knowing a readable character length, across the page, something that&amp;#8217;s comfortable to read with, something generally under about 70 characters or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underline in text, which we&amp;#8217;ll talk about links as we&amp;#8217;ll talk about. And, Just generally. also we tended to center things, didn&amp;#8217;t we? Yeah. Blocks of paragraphs, which were hard to read. So I think there&amp;#8217;s a lot of things that you and I would&amp;#8217;ve picked up because it&amp;#8217;s coming even to, those communities in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, pick up from a lot of people knowledgeable in that, about that kind of stuff. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;yeah. Yeah, whenever I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to somebody who is deeply embedded in this kind of thing, I am profoundly. Interested in the level of detail that you can get to with typography? Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re, obviously, in this episode, we&amp;#8217;re gonna scratch almost none of the surface even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re just, we&amp;#8217;re just touching the merest bit of it. But when you get into it, all of the different bits and pieces that make up a letter, there&amp;#8217;s so many words that are, ligatures and kerning and all of these different things, and I don&amp;#8217;t know what most of them are. Having a conversation though with these people always leaves me feeling, wow, there&amp;#8217;s a, that literally is a career just in that, just in learning typography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I think it&amp;#8217;s, I think it&amp;#8217;s not, I think the ship has sailed for me. David. No, I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:33] David Waumsley: we can start to, we can implement a lot of stuff that sat there. I think what makes me interested in it is. Following on from my last chat, we were talking about how difficult it is with images that I know even from the early web when I could look at somebody who knows typography, they can lay out a beautiful site with text only and I just think I wanna be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Anyway, shall we bring up the show notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, indeed. Indeed. Here we go. Okay, I&amp;#8217;ll just quick plug about this website, So you are looking at, if you are looking at this and not listening to it, but if you are listening to it and want to look at it, go to no script show. So that&amp;#8217;s the url, no script show, and then forward slash whatever episode we&amp;#8217;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is episode 11. no script show slash 11. We&amp;#8217;ll get you to this page. And what a, fantastic start you&amp;#8217;ve made at the top there, David. That looks like an image. Surely it&amp;#8217;s an image. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:32] David Waumsley: it&amp;#8217;s type, it&amp;#8217;s just using, I think, a fairly new property where we can, and I always forget what the name of it, I mention it later in the notes, so we&amp;#8217;ll come to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s a, basically a clipping two type. And then we can put an image showing through, so the, type is transparent and the image underneath it is clipped in it. So yeah, I thought I needed to do something a little bit fancy for this episode, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;But that is really, lovely, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Because just, the evolution of that in the day when we began, that was possible, but only as an image without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it&amp;#8217;s not. it, I, don&amp;#8217;t know how many people deploy this kind of typography, but that looks profoundly nice. it may not to be ev everybody&amp;#8217;s palette, the colors or what have you, but look at what&amp;#8217;s possible. Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s copy pastable. It is the word typography on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#8217;ve got all these lovely flowing colors in the background and it really sets it off. It&amp;#8217;s really alive at the very beginning, so Bravo. Lovely job. Yeah, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:34] David Waumsley: okay. Should we start with, we&amp;#8217;re looking at changes, so we&amp;#8217;ll start with the biggest change probably is the, responsive web and how typography had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;ll start talking, I think about responsive typography because we&amp;#8217;ve gone from that single screen resolution that we could all work to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s similar to print. Then we&amp;#8217;ve gone to. Responsive when we first got our sort of standard sizes for our most mobiles and tablets to now when we can make no assumptions about the viewport size of that our users have, or the pixel density as well that comes with those devices. So we, that&amp;#8217;s meant that we&amp;#8217;ve had quite a few shifts really, that the first one is from pixels to Rems as our unit for working with type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think with that I&amp;#8217;ve put down that it was once hotly debated. and it was up till quite recently, I think, with a lot of people still preferring pixels, still backwards looking on this, but I. And we were talking about this earlier, it&amp;#8217;s, been a recommendation for s from the W three C since we&amp;#8217;ve had CSS three, which is going back to 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 20,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;25 years that everybody&amp;#8217;s ignored it. Yeah, but that&amp;#8217;s because that&amp;#8217;s, largely because. They weren&amp;#8217;t able to use it. The browsers didn&amp;#8217;t keep up. Exactly right. Exactly. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:05] David Waumsley: And I think it still continued on because, It&amp;#8217;s, not just that, that the technology wasn&amp;#8217;t there to allow us with rems, it&amp;#8217;s just that we&amp;#8217;re so used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people have to convert often from a pixel perfect design onto the web, and they&amp;#8217;re used to working with pixels rather than, having something which is just non-static at all with rems. But I think the argument&amp;#8217;s over, and I don&amp;#8217;t think you&amp;#8217;ll find any experts that will. For pixels now because of the accessibility, because of the fact that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&amp;#8217;re unable a user&amp;#8217;s unable then to change their browser settings if they want something large and have that honored and have everything, proportionately changed. So I think REMS is definitely it because it&amp;#8217;s more manageable, it&amp;#8217;s more scalable. You, can change your mind about the overall size quite easily by changing the root percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;But, I guess a reason for. This not becoming the default also is because it&amp;#8217;s so much less intuitive to understand. It&amp;#8217;s there&amp;#8217;s, some weird number that you put in there which isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily an integer. And because of that it&amp;#8217;s hard to ga gauge what that means. And based upon what you&amp;#8217;ve got as the root font size them, it might look different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas with a pixel you put in 30 and assuming you&amp;#8217;re using the same font throughout the website, you know what that&amp;#8217;s gonna look like. And. 15 will be smaller by this exact amount, and 50 will be bigger by this exact amount. But, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t allow for the capacity to change it. I guess a trick in the page builders that we&amp;#8217;ve used is to use media queries and then change the font size within the mobile view and all of this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, better to just set it up once and get it right with, leading onto the next point, media queries and fluid typography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:59] David Waumsley: Yeah, exactly. REMS on their own. I, suppose they weren&amp;#8217;t as convincing us pixels and why the debate went on until we really got, viewport units and calc allowing us to move from media queries where we&amp;#8217;re saying, okay, it&amp;#8217;s gonna be this pixels at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view port width and there&amp;#8217;s gonna be, now we&amp;#8217;ve moved to fluid tire topography where we can use Cal and let the browser calculate it first. So I guess why the, why we&amp;#8217;ve everybody&amp;#8217;s accepted REMS now is because of the fact we could use fluid typography and we&amp;#8217;ve got these generators that takes all of the chore outta the maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my recommended one is the utopia. One, and there&amp;#8217;s a presentation I&amp;#8217;ve linked to it on the show notes there, which is worth watching by Tris Midford, who talks about not only their tool and what they&amp;#8217;re doing with it, but just generally fluid design. And it&amp;#8217;s made it so much easier because now, if I want to do anything now, I just go over to their tool and I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it starts with pixels. You put in what you want, right at the smallest size, your base layer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;going. Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:05] David Waumsley: You say, what do you imagine the pixels to be there? What do you imagine its largest size that you are accommodating. Put the pixel value expected and it does the calculation between those two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also allows you to change the typography scale, which is. Another thing again, which makes typography so much better. It&amp;#8217;s like musical notes. There are set types of scales that you do, so the spacing, and it will do all that for you. So as it&amp;#8217;s condensing down to a mobile, the type of scale that you might have at a large size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be less space between, the lettering and stuff. the text itself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;I, confess I&amp;#8217;ve not used that tool, but it sounds like a really valuable thing. So just in case you&amp;#8217;re listening to this on the audio, Google Utopia, CSS generator, and if you are able to get to our show notes, there&amp;#8217;s a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly there, so I should probably check that out. I confess I didn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:58] David Waumsley: No, there&amp;#8217;s a num I, I&amp;#8217;ve done a small video where I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned it as well and using it, and I, it&amp;#8217;s my favorite one. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of ones out there. Why I like it is because they&amp;#8217;re, they use it all the time. There&amp;#8217;s a few good designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Bell is one of them who uses it. All the time. and they&amp;#8217;re using it in Clear Left, which is, Jeremy Keith&amp;#8217;s agency as well. So they&amp;#8217;re supporting it. So they&amp;#8217;re really keeping up to date on things that are changing with typography as well. So that&amp;#8217;s why I like theirs above all others, but Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah. and it&amp;#8217;s got other things that go with it. Spacing as well, which I used. yeah, so I think, yeah, I never connected the dots until we started talking about the whole REM thing, but I think it&amp;#8217;s, everybody&amp;#8217;s jumped to rems when you can see, you can use the fluid typography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that seems to be the way I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;We should probably say at this point what the fluid ty, what fluid typography is, and if you&amp;#8217;ve never en encountered it, and you are using, I don&amp;#8217;t know, media queries to change bluntly, you&amp;#8217;ve got a, I don&amp;#8217;t know, a, font sizing pixels for desktop, a font sizing pixels for tablet, and a font sizing pixels for anything less than tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it mobile, then. This is different. This is where the, this is the allowance with fluid typography. That the, width, it&amp;#8217;s, it is a complete linear scale. If you, enlarge the, view port, given the constraints or what, what CSS you use, the typography will just grow proportionately and then reach some sort of maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#8217;re on, like a giant eight K monitor, it&amp;#8217;s not, gonna be truly enormous. It&amp;#8217;ll max out at some point that you set. But, it&amp;#8217;s beautiful watching it when you actually just grab the handles of your browser and reduce, enlarge, reduce enlarge, and you see the font size growing and shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually if, you think about that&amp;#8217;s what we should always have had. I. I wish we had that, but we didn&amp;#8217;t, tech technology didn&amp;#8217;t allow for it, but that&amp;#8217;s exactly what you want, right? I&amp;#8217;m on this size device and it&amp;#8217;s halfway between this and this. So the font is there and it&amp;#8217;s perfectly aligned for the viewport that I&amp;#8217;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. it&amp;#8217;s a shame that it&amp;#8217;s now a new thing rather than this has been around forever and ever since the dawn of the internet. And it&amp;#8217;s a kind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:13] David Waumsley: of compromise with it. &amp;#8217;cause I think when it first came out with the fluid typography, it was just saying, oh, we could use viewport width now to do everything right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you realize that you have to anchor that a little bit with a REM in there to make sure that, because if you do that, then users can&amp;#8217;t zoom out on their browser. So you there&amp;#8217;s a strange anchor and the mass of it become very difficult. So you are not absolutely fully assure, unless you, move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your browser to see how it&amp;#8217;s responding. But it does get over that big hiccup in the fact that once where we have used the responsive to set them to our known mobiles and tablet sizes, we found that many are just before the break point that you might be reaching and then suddenly their text is out proportion to the size of their device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And you get this horrible jump in, so it gets rid of that. Yeah. And it&amp;#8217;s, it is lovely, isn&amp;#8217;t it? yeah. I think another thing that&amp;#8217;s changed, at least for me, this might be my ignorance, but there&amp;#8217;s a sort of move away, I think from our browsers would generally sort out the spacing on an element by element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis, or we would style elements. we would put the margins of the paddings that we wanted on our individual elements. Now, I think there&amp;#8217;s more of an interest in looking at flow because we want to control uniformly the. The space that we&amp;#8217;ve got between our paragraphs and stuff. So there are a couple of, again, a couple of things that I would recommend for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the stack, which is on every layout, which is, again, Andy Bell, who I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned, and probably a key person behind this is Hayden Pickering, because 10 years ago now, he came up with something called. atomic, which you called the No, it was the Lobotomized Owl. Oh, this little selector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. Yeah. it&amp;#8217;s, he always had this problem, so if you put pad in padding on the bottom of your paragraphs, then the last paragraph would always have that padding that you didn&amp;#8217;t want. So he&amp;#8217;s used this little technique to be able to. Effectively set it on the top of your paragraph, but by using these Lobotomized owl, it&amp;#8217;s a child so that, so he doesn&amp;#8217;t select the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so there&amp;#8217;s something that you can uniform the spaces. And there&amp;#8217;s also a wonderful demo as well. Definitely recommended. I wanna watch it again by, Mike. May who&amp;#8217;s a really good person on typography and he is got lots of tools as well, that you can use, but is on a show by Ben Meyers called some antics Do dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, that&amp;#8217;s clever Semantic. I love what a clever name. Yeah, And you&amp;#8217;ve gotta watch that. if you&amp;#8217;re really into typography, I&amp;#8217;ve gotta watch it again. &amp;#8217;cause I didn&amp;#8217;t, it went over my head. But it really discusses that whole idea of flow and he sets it more manually. But, yeah, and I think that&amp;#8217;s a kind of fairly new thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Again, links in the show notes, both of those things. The stack and the typography demo by Mike May, my, I&amp;#8217;m not sure, is in the show notes. And then we&amp;#8217;ve got these new units, which honestly I don&amp;#8217;t know anywhere near enough about, so I&amp;#8217;m hoping that you are actually gonna school me here. This&amp;#8217;ll be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:27] David Waumsley: I&amp;#8217;m pretty poor on them. One that I do use. So we&amp;#8217;ve got ch which is for character, so we can set our. Width of things by the character length, which is really, useful for that problem that I mentioned earlier about the fact that we tend to, or I did, tend to put too many words. I. On a full view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so it&amp;#8217;s not very readable. You can set with your character length, and that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m doing actually on the site that you&amp;#8217;re looking at. So what&amp;#8217;s setting the length of the inner container here is the characters. I think it&amp;#8217;s set at 70. So effectively the text within that can expand beyond that. So a lot of people are using that in part of the responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you set that maximum on all of your paragraphs, then wherever you&amp;#8217;re gonna place &amp;#8217;em in your design, you know it&amp;#8217;s going to be. Fairly readable, you said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:15] David Waumsley: interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay. That&amp;#8217;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:17] David Waumsley: Yeah, and something I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever used yet, which is X, the Ex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is ex Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve never used this. No, it&amp;#8217;s based, it&amp;#8217;s a little bit like M&amp;#8217;S are based on the, the font, M size, and we get REMS from that because we get root elements. X is the same. It&amp;#8217;s something in typography, which again, I don&amp;#8217;t understand, which is set in the, height of the X basically is something measuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you get clever people like Mike May, who knows how to use these, they will actually use that value for setting the heights. They will use that for. Knowing what is the correct line height to put according to the font that you&amp;#8217;re using? Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;this rings a bell. it&amp;#8217;s got, it has got some characteristic of the letter X, hasn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can&amp;#8217;t remember why that letter in particular. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just got certain height or width ratio. Yeah. Can&amp;#8217;t remember, but yeah. Okay. That&amp;#8217;s fascinating. So not the letter X, but EX in this case. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:18] David Waumsley: EX in this case. I&amp;#8217;ve never used it yet, but it&amp;#8217;s really for, if you do understand that you might be setting certain things against the, X value of the font if you really understand the font you are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are styling into that. Yeah, it goes a bit above me. And then of course we got the. We&amp;#8217;ve already talked about them. We&amp;#8217;ve got the sort of a viewport width of Viewport height. We can start using an viewport minimum of Viewport Max. And someone like Mike May, again, I really don&amp;#8217;t use V Max yet, but he might use it to section the sort of space he will put on sections of his site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So his header, his footer, his main, The leftover space at the bottom, he&amp;#8217;ll be setting this to percentage. So depending on the browser itself, it will allow a little bit more space or less as needed. So again, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s one way of doing it. But again, I use other things in Utopia for spacing to, set spacing so it changes according to the size of the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#8217;s lots of different ways to skin this particular cat, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. And no doubt a Google around each of these will give you, yeah, a lot more information. But yeah, some of those a mystery to me. Some of them I&amp;#8217;ve definitely used. Okay. Shall we move on? Yeah. Yeah. Accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:33] David Waumsley: again, that&amp;#8217;s a big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awareness boost that we&amp;#8217;ve had recently over accessibility, maybe because it&amp;#8217;s becoming law for us. So if we do it professionally, I guess we should be aware of these things. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot of changes there. we&amp;#8217;ve talked about this before. There&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;ve really gone from this western bias on the web to now having writing modes and internationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So we, I think we talked, Rachel Andrews talked about that when we were talking. I think it was in episode three when we talked about how we need to know this concept to know our CSS layouts. But there are lots of other things coming along with that. I noticed, I was just listening to the latest release, on Chrome where they have started to put in place something so you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal with, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters and stuff, and kind of space those out, Oh, interesting. That&amp;#8217;s a big shift. Interesting. Yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. So we were saying before the call began, weren&amp;#8217;t we before we hit record, at least that, at least I don&amp;#8217;t, really even think about the, web as, a Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character thing. Yes. if I ever see something like that, I, I&amp;#8217;ve clearly strayed into an area of the web that I can&amp;#8217;t access &amp;#8217;cause I can&amp;#8217;t read Chinese. But just think of the population and the fact that all of these browsers in the past, at least anyway, were really configured for, left to top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. and the character set being, a Latin alphabet. And of course most of the world don&amp;#8217;t, use any of that. But, but we&amp;#8217;re educated to think about that. and even, the things that we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about, the ex is based upon the, Latin character X and so on. And I don&amp;#8217;t even know where to begin with typography with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know, a Chinese character set. I, no idea what the concerns are there. I do know that there&amp;#8217;s a history of, calligraphy and making those characters look beautiful. I would say even more so than we have in the West with our typography, that there seems to be a real heritage in, I. when they paint the Chinese characters, making them look beautiful and adding weight to certain strokes so that they enlarge in one part and diminish in another, and then, tail off into sort of, almost nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. Yeah. And, yeah. Fascinating. I&amp;#8217;d, love to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:10] David Waumsley: into that. It&amp;#8217;s interesting &amp;#8217;cause I think the new things that you brought out for them is, a word break and auto phase for them. And also trimming because how, how their text is getting aligned in the sort of spacing isn&amp;#8217;t. Always perfect on the web and kind of, this is all still new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems incredible that you should have such a large population of people Yeah. Who have not been accommodated so far on the web. But that&amp;#8217;s definitely a change and it knocks onto us. &amp;#8217;cause even if we never deal with those, we&amp;#8217;ve had to understand things like Flexbox and grid layouts in terms of writing modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve needed to have that concept to be able to align things properly. So yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a massive change. Shall I move to the next thing? sure. That is our shift away from what we had when we started, which was only web, say fonts or system fonts to this abundance of open source options. Google fonts particularly, and then back to, I think I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not, this is, this keeps going backwards and forwards I&amp;#8217;m sure to a few quality fonts that you use that have all the character sets that are, flexible or a trend a bit back to considering system fonts again, I. So I did a little video on that one before, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d3bfbcbcb8babdb493bebcb7b6a1bdb5bcbda7a0a7b2b0b8fdb0bcbe&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to see what, what fonts are available on different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you get a little screenshot of it as well, so you can see how they might pan out if you do want to use them. But there&amp;#8217;s a real, I. I think from a accessibility point of view is the fact that probably what helps people with dyslexia above anything else or other things is familiarity. So if it&amp;#8217;s your system font that you&amp;#8217;re using for your body text, if that&amp;#8217;s an apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should be seeing there, I think should be San Francisco on your screen. this is a variable font. It&amp;#8217;s a, font that we couldn&amp;#8217;t license and, for many people that&amp;#8217;s just gonna be familiar. So it&amp;#8217;s a good font to use perhaps, rather than bringing in a custom one where we don&amp;#8217;t need to, where it doesn&amp;#8217;t add any extra value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, I think we all got a bit carried away when Google fonts came around, didn&amp;#8217;t we? Dumping, just dumping every kind of imaginable font that we could because it looked quirky and interesting. And I, think you&amp;#8217;re right. I think there&amp;#8217;s definitely a move away from that, in the WordPress space and CMS space and, webspace, localizing those fonts, I guess is a, recent endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, GDPR and all that kind of thing. But, but I, think you&amp;#8217;re right. I think going back to system fonts and something which is familiar. for functional text. Text, like we&amp;#8217;re seeing on the screen now where we&amp;#8217;re just trying to get information from us to you where the flare and the novelty of it is really not the point then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. But obviously if I was to go to, I don&amp;#8217;t know, the latest band&amp;#8217;s website, the latest pop stars website, where that sort of creativity is trying to be emphasized. Maybe the bit about how tickets, how much tickets cost, and where the venue is. Maybe that&amp;#8217;d be a web safe font. the bit about, what the artist does and who they are, especially the headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You you, still feel you&amp;#8217;ve gotta go a bit knots with that because, &amp;#8217;cause it, that&amp;#8217;s part of the whole typography thing is allowing you to be creative. But I&amp;#8217;m like you, but maybe it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8217;cause I&amp;#8217;m old and my eyes are starting to fail a bit more. I&amp;#8217;ve got glasses on and things I want, I would just want clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want everything to be, the contrast between the background and the font. To be clear, I need it to be readable. I need it to be spaced out and I, I honestly don&amp;#8217;t care too much for the, for the snazzy fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:55] David Waumsley: Yeah, and I, just think, obviously with the other pressures, the kind of green pressures and the speed pressures as well, that, if there&amp;#8217;s not a good reason to argue for a custom font, we don&amp;#8217;t necessarily stick it in and, but that&amp;#8217;s not been my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 10 years, it&amp;#8217;s been like, woo. Which, of all these fonts that, Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Which one might Crow are in? But don&amp;#8217;t you have, I can&amp;#8217;t remember the last time this happened to me, but when you stumble across a website where they&amp;#8217;ve just got text, so imagery is out the window, it&amp;#8217;s just, plain background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Beautiful typography, something clear, readable. They&amp;#8217;ve obviously thought about the layout a lot. Yeah, it really does. It compels you. It just sucks you in, Yeah. it, it&amp;#8217;s, really profound what fonts can do. In fact, we said this before we began the show. The. A website where clearly somebody&amp;#8217;s put a lot of effort into fonts and making their typography look amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It it really knocks it out the park. It takes something ordinary and makes it into extraordinary, but it, I don&amp;#8217;t end up looking at the font particularly. I just get this profound sense. Oh, that&amp;#8217;s clever. That&amp;#8217;s really beautiful. Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m now gonna go and explore what font that is and what the wits that they&amp;#8217;re using and all of these kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, sorry, digression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:14] David Waumsley: Yeah, no, that&amp;#8217;s fine. the next point in some ways I think I&amp;#8217;ve made it already, but, perhaps a trend in that from moving to browser setting the line heights and stuff, or as individually doing it to, and proximity according to fonts use. So in some ways we have some guidance about line height is usually the biggest problem for people not being able to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;ve got your paragraphs and you&amp;#8217;ve not got the right amount, and you can go to something like war gag. the, actually there&amp;#8217;s another little thing on there. If you hover over the wagg, you&amp;#8217;ll see I&amp;#8217;m using, oh, it&amp;#8217;s under lined with a, I&amp;#8217;m using the abbreviation here. Another bit of typography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the web content accessibility guidelines. Oh, sadly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;our video platform doesn&amp;#8217;t pick that up. That&amp;#8217;s interesting. Ah, that&amp;#8217;s, but, I am hovering over something and on my screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:03] David Waumsley: Ah, interesting. Oh, I can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:04] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;see it. And, it, there, there&amp;#8217;s a little, like a, tool tip if you like, that&amp;#8217;s the browser has provided, which pops up to, to give me the context of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on, on the video, it&amp;#8217;s not come through. There&amp;#8217;s, there must be some reason for that. But anyway, there we go. And I think,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:19] David Waumsley: there&amp;#8217;s more awareness of lots of things about giving line height and, the experts will know how to do that against the, fonts. The waggle will give us guidelines, like it should be roughly about 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s a unitless height, so it takes the value of the. The unit for the font that you&amp;#8217;ve said. and there were other things that I wasn&amp;#8217;t aware of until recently is the, and it&amp;#8217;s probably failing on this site. the idea of proximity, the idea that we need to leave a little bit more on a header when there&amp;#8217;s some paragraph text underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, on the header itself, the space above it needs to be more than the space before you get to the paragraph. So the proximity of the header two. The paragraph underneath is grouped together, and that makes for better reading. So these, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;interesting. I&amp;#8217;ve always found that to be strange when you look at that, when you see it on somebody else&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. It looks correct, but when you are in the weeds and you are looking at, let&amp;#8217;s say, I don&amp;#8217;t know the, padding above a heading, I always want to get rid of it. I want it to go away. But, then when I look at it on the front end, oh yeah, no, that, that looks right because it, you do need to give that little bit of breathing space, don&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit&amp;#8217;s finished. We&amp;#8217;re now onto a new heading. There needs to be a, proportionate gap to show, okay, this is an H four. There&amp;#8217;s a. There&amp;#8217;s something going on there. This is an H three something and this is an H two something else. but I, always, have this intuition. I want to erase it, but I generally don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:51] David Waumsley: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s just that, it&amp;#8217;s just so you can see what content belongs with what which kind of belongs with the content below. Just proximity is one of those things which I&amp;#8217;m becoming more aware of all the time. as you listen to more people who know UX design and have that. Formal training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just looking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;for it on this page. And we, you don&amp;#8217;t really have too much use of that, do you? You&amp;#8217;ve got these great big, I&amp;#8217;m guessing these are H twos or something like that, but, it should be, if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:14] David Waumsley: I&amp;#8217;ve done it I probably haven&amp;#8217;t, it should have a little bit more space above. Oh, it definitely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;it looks like it, there&amp;#8217;s a little, you probably can&amp;#8217;t see on the screen. There&amp;#8217;s a little gray box here and the distance between the v and the box. Oh, no, it definitely is. There&amp;#8217;s definitely a little bit more. Okay. Alright, Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:34] David Waumsley: the, next point under accessibility was just a, move, that we&amp;#8217;ve seen, I think recently about earlier we tended to see underlining as visual clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something that you, on your links I&amp;#8217;m talking about here, to now respecting it as a essential. UI and I think we&amp;#8217;ve been given some new tools that go along with that one that I most and I&amp;#8217;m using it all the time. If you see that, yeah, you are where the links are there, there&amp;#8217;s a, bit of a space between it, and that&amp;#8217;s because of the new property, which is the textline, underlining offset where you can actually offset that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we, none of the descendants are touching on it. and also you can set the. Thickness of that line as well. You can make it a little bit thinner and obviously you can color it. So we&amp;#8217;ve got a lot more control over our links. Now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;I really like what you&amp;#8217;ve done here. So obviously the descender, the G here in, in whatever font this is not particularly, it&amp;#8217;s not particularly long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G doesn&amp;#8217;t descend that far. Yeah, but still. The, little gap that you&amp;#8217;ve got here, which is bigger than I would expect normally is nice. it really does make that kind of feel like it&amp;#8217;s, I don&amp;#8217;t know, it&amp;#8217;s not breaking up the, flow when my eyes going from left to right and reading through it, that line is out the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So I&amp;#8217;m able to read it as normal text and keep going. and I do the fact that the line isn&amp;#8217;t broken up. and, sorry, one last thing. And I do think that this has to become the default, doesn&amp;#8217;t it? I think we all just need to settle on underlining is the way to do it? Yeah, just let&amp;#8217;s all go back to underlining please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:10] David Waumsley: It&amp;#8217;s become a, I think, setting also this offset, is quite nice. And I think some people have put it in their CSS resets if there&amp;#8217;s no other style against it or class against it that will be there. Stephanie Eccles does that and and I think that&amp;#8217;s. A really, it&amp;#8217;s only recent this, that we were able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can see why people are wanting to remove stuff, even though you do break up the line by default of browsers. If there is a descender, it can be a little bit uncomfortable to read. But yes, I think the argument now is that we should, and, to be honest, we&amp;#8217;re just going back to arguments that we&amp;#8217;re there from the nineties, so we,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:47] David Waumsley: Jacob Nielsen, who was always saying, you must underline your links. You must underline your links. And somehow we got designers got into the idea that it was just a bit clutter and we&amp;#8217;ll remove it, it&amp;#8217;s fine and it really isn&amp;#8217;t fine. And the way to know that is just imagine I. That you can&amp;#8217;t see color, and then you&amp;#8217;ll know it&amp;#8217;s not fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And imagine that. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a nice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;way. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:07] David Waumsley: Simple. Or, imagine that your device is a black and white device, a monochrome device. Yeah. And suddenly you&amp;#8217;ve removed what the web basically is. It&amp;#8217;s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;yeah. That&amp;#8217;s really a good point. Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s a perfect encapsulation of why. It needs to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are, if you cannot see color, just imagine it in black and white. And here it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear. Also, I guess your, the, line height, the gap between the, this, row of text and this row of text is enough to allow that. To breathe, if Yeah. So the, under, let&amp;#8217;s, yeah, this is a better example &amp;#8217;cause you can see more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underline here, you&amp;#8217;ve got the offset, which is quite generous, but still not too much. But it&amp;#8217;s still not interfering with the road. Be below the, the line below it. This is still not being interfered with by this. And you can actually see that in the. The way it&amp;#8217;s being highlighted. So that&amp;#8217;s nice. nicely Don David,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:03] David Waumsley: basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we&amp;#8217;re using system fonts here, so I&amp;#8217;m not actually sure whether, the line height is right on yours as it is on the one that I see on the Interesting. So, it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a guesswork on that, I think. Anyway. Yeah, so I think that&amp;#8217;s definitely a move. And it was, it&amp;#8217;s down to the fact that we had frameworks like Bootstrap, which were hugely popular, that didn&amp;#8217;t underline their links by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s changed now. Bootstrap. Yeah. But anyway. Okay. Should we move on to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:29] David Waumsley: bit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;of technology? Yeah, we&amp;#8217;d better race, actually. We&amp;#8217;re on. Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re on. not, I&amp;#8217;m not sure exactly how long, but we&amp;#8217;ve added up quite a few minutes. So let&amp;#8217;s just put the, put the pedal to the metal. Is that what they say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like that. There&amp;#8217;s a lot to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:42] David Waumsley: cover here. Yeah. Variable fonts. We can cover them. Fairly quickly. there&amp;#8217;s a big, change in the fact that we used to have to support multiple font formats. &amp;#8217;cause there&amp;#8217;s a whole history with them. So we had the TTF, the OFT. I can&amp;#8217;t remember the what they stand for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, there were a whole history, I think you know, the true type form. There&amp;#8217;s the first one that was Microsoft and Apple getting together back in the eighties. And then you get. Variations that have come on those to make them fit better with the web. Things like, I think the OFT added ligatures and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we&amp;#8217;ve got the embedded ot, which was the one to work very well with IE. And then finally the world, worldwide web consortium got together and had a body for, fonts. And then that&amp;#8217;s when we got Wolff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Honestly, if you, if you get me to transcribe this with AI software, the last paragraph you just said will be so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:45] David Waumsley: So, we get the web open font format, which is what we&amp;#8217;ve got. And from 2010, so this is really the recommendation from the Ws. Three C from 2010, and then they further optimize it. So we get WF two now support is there for WF two. So we&amp;#8217;ve basically gone from having to support all these, this history of formats to really being able to pretty much, unless we need to support IE, to get away with WF two, which is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay. Yay. What do, yeah. And the, great thing about this, which leads us really to the variable fonts is the fact that, the. That&amp;#8217;s the format for variable fonts, and I think that&amp;#8217;s the big trend now is the fact that instead of having to load individually the weights or the italic versions of the font that we&amp;#8217;re using, is that we can have this all within the one WF two format and use CSS to fine control the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we want some. Bizarre weight. So we want it, instead of it going from 300 to 400 and we want 3, 2, 5, or something as the exact weight, we can do it with the variable fonts. And if we want our italics to slightly slant in a different way, we can do it with the CSS. So I think that&amp;#8217;s really exciting, at the moment that we can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside, of course, is that you. if you&amp;#8217;re only using a couple of weights or something and you&amp;#8217;re not using all this extra, then they are a bit heavier than loading those individually. And finally, yeah, we put down, which I think we&amp;#8217;ll just skip &amp;#8217;cause I think we&amp;#8217;ll need to come back to it &amp;#8217;cause I don&amp;#8217;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color or chromatic fonts. Chromatic is the correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:25] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;word. no. I have no understanding of this. Anyway. It&amp;#8217;s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:29] David Waumsley: It&amp;#8217;s a thing. Yeah. And actually it brings in a new format. I think it&amp;#8217;s taking one of the old formats with SVGs and I think there&amp;#8217;s not clarity over what that is. There are some, Google fonts out there, which are chromatic fonts that you can play around with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, don&amp;#8217;t quite get the value yet because I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;don&amp;#8217;t, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m on trying to understand what the purpose is, if you, we can set the color of a font fairly straightforwardly in CSS I&amp;#8217;m interested to see what the benefit is. What, are we getting out of it? Is it that fonts can be, I don&amp;#8217;t know, can there be gradients in font colors, or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:04] David Waumsley: exactly. I think it&amp;#8217;s exactly that and I think, you can do a lot of the tilting and rotating and stuff of your fonts, which can create some lovely effects. But in the ones that I&amp;#8217;ve seen around, the only thing where I could see I&amp;#8217;d use it and, effectively it&amp;#8217;s no dissimilar from what I&amp;#8217;m doing on the top header of this post where I&amp;#8217;m got an image coming through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where I&amp;#8217;ve seen a color font being used, say it&amp;#8217;s saying the word pizza and the background, the images of pizza and. Think, I&amp;#8217;m not going to load this quite heavy color font to do that when I can do it with a, kind of simple. Clip masking like this for myself, so yeah. Yeah. The value&amp;#8217;s not there yet for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. We&amp;#8217;ll have to see. Perhaps I don&amp;#8217;t understand it. yeah. Alright. That&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;variable. Fonts. Now we&amp;#8217;re onto some lesser used specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:49] David Waumsley: Yeah, I just wanted to mention a couple of things on typography &amp;#8217;cause they were relatively new to me, so I put an example up on there. So something which is really when we&amp;#8217;re talking about responsive again, it&amp;#8217;s not used and that&amp;#8217;s CSS columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually this is so cool. This is so great. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s, it is just simply that you can set. Columns for any of the things that you want, and you can make it responsive. It&amp;#8217;s not by default. So if we have a column count of two, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be responsive. We&amp;#8217;d, we would need a media query. But what I&amp;#8217;ve done on here, because there is a, limited space anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve put it so it&amp;#8217;s just magic numbers with this, but I&amp;#8217;ve put it at 18 res here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s created two columns while there&amp;#8217;s more than the 18 res to it. But if you. If you zoom in on this one, it will just automatically,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;see what we get. Oh, collapse. Probably make that in the center. Zoom. Let&amp;#8217;s put that right in the middle there. So I&amp;#8217;m gonna collapse the screen. We&amp;#8217;ve still got two columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there look, there we go. There&amp;#8217;s some magic moment there. It collapses down into the one column. That&amp;#8217;s super useful. That&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:54] David Waumsley: So sometimes we just, bring in grid and all of that stuff where we could simply do it with CSS columns. It&amp;#8217;s been there for some time. I think the spec&amp;#8217;s been tightened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, It&amp;#8217;s, Rachel, Andrew has been working on this as well, who worked on grid quite a lot. So anyway, it&amp;#8217;s just a really cool trick which gets ignored. And I think there are lots of other little things which I&amp;#8217;m just becoming aware of. So I&amp;#8217;ve put a drop shadow in there. It&amp;#8217;s another little bit of, on the t on my paragraph there, it&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see that it&amp;#8217;s, I&amp;#8217;ve styled it slightly different, used a different font, and it&amp;#8217;s going over one and a half of the text a little bit more because I&amp;#8217;ve put a little border around it on there. And this is something, though, it&amp;#8217;s not very well supported at the moment. So it&amp;#8217;s a combination of using first letter as a, pseudo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element. Or class, I think. And then initial letter as a drop cap to do that. So these kind of things. Yeah. And then there&amp;#8217;s a whole thing, I won&amp;#8217;t go into too much here else, we&amp;#8217;ll go on forever, but I think there&amp;#8217;s a whole lot of HTML, which we underuse. So I&amp;#8217;ve just given one example here where I&amp;#8217;m using the keyboard one, rather than having to pull in an image, I can style the the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBD tag and create this kind of little control shift, enter keys or any key that I want. Just with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;They&amp;#8217;re nice, aren&amp;#8217;t they? They look really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:22] David Waumsley: Yeah. I think all the pros, the people who&amp;#8217;ve been in this game longer than me will put these in their explanations, but I think it&amp;#8217;s, definitely worth looking at lots of, HTML because we just don&amp;#8217;t use many of the tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Mark, we don&amp;#8217;t use, we don&amp;#8217;t often put a. Different styling for time. All of these are tags which we often forget about, particularly if we&amp;#8217;ve come from a background of A CMS, we just put those in. and, I&amp;#8217;m using one actually on the top of the title there, so I&amp;#8217;m actually using one which I&amp;#8217;d entirely forgotten about until I started writing this, which is, the, let me just find it on the notes so I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one called. Somewhere. There it is. It&amp;#8217;s WBR, which is, there it is. It&amp;#8217;s basically, yes. It is given a width, it&amp;#8217;s width break opportunity, I think. And if you go to the top of the site here as I&amp;#8217;ve got a huge, typography here. I&amp;#8217;m actually using that to separate typo and graph. So if you slim in on that one when it hasn&amp;#8217;t got the room, oh, this is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t do, we didn&amp;#8217;t try this before the show started. No. So I&amp;#8217;m making it smaller. We got the word typography. It will eventually break. Yay. Look at that. That&amp;#8217;s so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:39] David Waumsley: great. So you could tell us where, if you really do want to keep your massive font or something, you might want to decide where it breaks, and that&amp;#8217;s an opportunity to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a regular break, which will just break it for everybody. This breaks when there&amp;#8217;s the opportunity to break. You can set it wherever you like, multiple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;things in one word or. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:57] David Waumsley: Yes. Yeah, exactly. So it&amp;#8217;s just sometimes you want your word to break in a different way. Yeah. If you&amp;#8217;re gonna keep it big, probably I should have just made it small, but, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#8217;s probably enough &amp;#8217;cause I&amp;#8217;m covering, yeah, the stuff. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about the new spec, shall we? okay, here we go. Couple of things here. That&amp;#8217;s, one that&amp;#8217;s only in Safari only, which I think is really handy, which is hanging punctuation, which will allow, and I&amp;#8217;ve heard this being talked about a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People get annoyed at that. If you&amp;#8217;ve got a block quote and the, you styled up your quotes on what, you&amp;#8217;re gonna put the quotes up there anyway, those quotes are going to indent your text. Yeah, And it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier if people keep. Running down vertically and see everything aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what hanging punctuation could do is to make sure that you get to choose that it goes outside. So you&amp;#8217;d have to use a lot of CSS to try and force your right. Yeah, there would be a lot of negative margins and all that nonsense. So that&amp;#8217;s quite cool, when it&amp;#8217;s supported. But it&amp;#8217;s safari only at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got font size adjust, which I talked about, about a year ago with doing stuff. Performance. it&amp;#8217;s just, it&amp;#8217;s the most useful thing is the fact that you can adjust, some of these fonts. Usually a fallback font, which might be a system font or something. So you can change its X shape, you can stretch it out a little bit so it can better match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. The custom font that is waiting to load. So it stops this sort of jarring when it&amp;#8217;s going from the system fallback font to the custom font loading in. So you can line them up a little bit better with that. it&amp;#8217;s limited availability at the moment, and there&amp;#8217;s, font ing, that&amp;#8217;s fully supported at the moment, which allows us to, Browsers Will, kerning is spacing basically between letters. Yeah. Yeah. Browsers will do that for themselves. If you want to force it, you can force it so that it&amp;#8217;s set by the font or you can let the browser do it, or you can just turn it off altogether if you are controlling that. So that&amp;#8217;s a, fully supported thing, but fairly new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the thing that was. Making the, my title with the image coming through it is the background clip, which is beautiful. yeah, quite new but widely available now, and yeah, it&amp;#8217;s just used for clipping backgrounds on there and it&amp;#8217;s useful with text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay. Okay. So they&amp;#8217;re all in the show notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no. All in the show notes, no script show slash 11. And then you&amp;#8217;ve got a little flourish at the end here, haven&amp;#8217;t you? You&amp;#8217;ve got something nice to. Yeah, if you scroll, scroll. Now. I scroll up. Scroll up. Hold on. I&amp;#8217;ll wait for it. You have to see this or go to the webpage. okay. I&amp;#8217;m gonna scroll up slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That little word typography, which is orientated at 90 degrees is fading in and out. I&amp;#8217;m noticing that. What am I waiting for? Oh, at that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh my. Yeah. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:52] David Waumsley: You&amp;#8217;ve even got a little bounce going on there. Yeah, I borrowed it from somebody else. I must credit them, and I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten who it is. It&amp;#8217;s somebody I do follow and I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten, but I&amp;#8217;ve amended it slightly just for hours. But yes, really this is just to highlight just the last bit of change, if you like, in our history, and I think this is really significant, only in the Chrome at the moment, but we&amp;#8217;ve got scroll animation, which means that we can do a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool animations and stuff, with our text as I&amp;#8217;m just showing off here. It&amp;#8217;s a little bit over. It&amp;#8217;s great though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:47:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;Isn&amp;#8217;t, that brilliant. and again, obviously the purview of JavaScript forever, this was, the only way to do it and now all of this stuff is coming to CSS. Yeah. it is a bit flashy, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s quite a lot going on there to make you make your eyes water, but you get the point. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be quite so dramatic as that, but something subtle. Something just sort fading in or moving slightly to the left or the right could be very profound. That&amp;#8217;s lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:47:48] David Waumsley: I think it&amp;#8217;s really nice that it&amp;#8217;s coming to a lan, language that we can understand, rather than JavaScript and you really rely on languages and it makes it a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if your, browser had been set to prefer reduced motion in some form or another, then you won&amp;#8217;t get that bounce and you&amp;#8217;ll get the fade in slightly. You won&amp;#8217;t get the bouncing because it can just wrap that in the CSS to be able to do that. I, I. That&amp;#8217;s great. And I&amp;#8217;ve also put the tilted text here just to show that we can have some fun with writing modes these days, and particularly if it that&amp;#8217;s combined with the better positioning that we&amp;#8217;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it, it&amp;#8217;s maybe not lined up perfectly &amp;#8217;cause they had to do it quickly, but it&amp;#8217;s using grid to put it side by side. So Grid and Subgrid given us the ability to place more accurately our texts and we can, as we&amp;#8217;re showing here with the writing mode changing that we can turn it on its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s nice. It&amp;#8217;s really nice. Yeah. Yeah. And that&amp;#8217;s it. And I just think that&amp;#8217;s the way things are going. I think typography is becoming a big thing. People are using blending, filtering, masking, overlapping with other elements and all these kind of things to tell stories these days on their web and need less images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you can do a lot with good typography, and it can all be. Fully accessible. You can turn off the styling and anyone can read the text document screen. Readers can read it. So I think typography just come such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;a long way. I think this episode has been profoundly interesting. Can I urge you if you have listened to this or even watched it on the screen, go, to no script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep saying I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ve said episode 11 throughout this whole thing. And of course it&amp;#8217;s actually episode 12, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m sorry about that. anytime I&amp;#8217;ve said episode 11, ignore that it&amp;#8217;s actually episode 12 and go check it out. No script show slash 12. I&amp;#8217;ll correct that in the, in the transcript hopefully, and go and see, what marvelous things David has put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all there loads of links, loads of opportunity for you to learn and figure out all this stuff. Wow. For yourself. Learn with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:55] David Waumsley: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s, yeah. We bitten off more than can chew really with this episode. It&amp;#8217;s gone on quite a long time, so we&amp;#8217;ll probably have to close up. It&amp;#8217;s been a long one,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley: &lt;/strong&gt;so shall we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall we knock it on the head there? Yeah. Okay. We&amp;#8217;ll be back soon. Who knows when? We don&amp;#8217;t have a set schedule, but we&amp;#8217;ll be back at some point in the near future with episode 12, no 13 saving himself. So I&amp;#8217;ll see you next time. Thanks, David. Yeah, thank you. Cheers. Bye bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finally, a delightful free accessibility tool. Silktide&#39;s accessibility checker</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/11/" />
    <updated>2024-06-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/11/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not my planned follow-up, but in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/10&quot;&gt;last video&lt;/a&gt; I ended up testing the accessibility of a light and dark theme toggle using NVDA&#39;s screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of my frustration with that, I discovered a fabulous new and free &lt;a href=&quot;https://silktide.com/toolbar/&quot;&gt;accessibility checker by Silktide&lt;/a&gt; that includes a simple screen reader simulator. I think it&#39;s the only checker to include this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the W3C defines accessibility testing as a subset of usability testing, I&#39;m particularly pleased to find a user-friendly accessibility tool that I genuinely look forward to using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s comprehensive enough to allow me to lose some other accessibility add-ons (accumulated, but hardly used) and is designed so well that I can imagine using it on client calls to demonstrate the unseen work done on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFMY8cLubD4&quot;&gt;10-Minute Web Accessibility Audit webinar&lt;/a&gt; by Silktide&#39;s eloquent and knowledgeable CEO Oliver Emberton. He can explain his tool better than I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-screen-reader-alone-makes-it-praiseworthy&quot;&gt;The screen reader alone makes it praiseworthy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this to spread the word because I don&#39;t have to be so modest about its value to users like me, particularly the screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screen reader is not fully fledged and only works on the page you are testing, but that&#39;s its strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rightly highlight its ease of use, but the real joy for me is that it&#39;s just where I need it and that its functionality is confined to the website page we are testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found running the NVDA desktop app, as a sighted user, difficult. As soon as I start the reader for testing I want to go into my code editor to make changes, run other tests, or look things up. It comes with me because its real job is to assist me with everything I do on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be my lack of experience, and there are extensions or settings to help, but having watched some demos by experienced blind people I suspect this will never feel easy for me. I&#39;m also lazy when it comes to firing up desktop applications for quick tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it&#39;s important to read the limitations of this screen reader. They have applied the 80/20 rule, so it won&#39;t entirely remove the need to test with a full screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example:&lt;/strong&gt; In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/10&quot;&gt;last video&lt;/a&gt; I was unsure about the poor results with aria-live on a light/dark theme toggle. I did not know whether it was a user error on my part, the inappropriate use of this code, or just a screen reader bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screen reader will not help with that as aria-live is not supported. Neither can I hover and have the alt text read to me as CSS hover will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;details&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in our HTML, it will not work. I suspect anything where the browser treats the elements as a component could be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations aside, I think this is a great way to introduce more designers to screen readers. I&#39;ve often thought I should use one regularly so it naturally becomes a part of my design thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👋 Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I contacted Silktide thinking there could be a bug as my selected Google voices were falling silent at about 280 characters. It seemed only to be with Google voices. No problems with the Microsoft one. I need to test more, but don&#39;t think it is an issue for Silktide, but let me know if you encounter the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-the-accessibility-checker&quot;&gt;How to get the accessibility checker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mpobacholfblmnpnfbiomjkecoojakah&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to add it to Microsoft Edge (and perhaps other Chromium browsers). As of May 2024, there is no Firefox extension, but it is in their sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other additions are likely to come, but I suspect much will depend on how much attention this receives. To justify the time, I imagine it also needs to work as a good marketing tool for Silktide&#39;s business, where they have more sophisticated premium checkers that monitor and report on full sites and go beyond accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to avoid endorsing businesses, but I don&#39;t think this is any different from using WebAIM&#39;s Wave, IBM&#39;s Equal Access Toolkit, or Google&#39;s Lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a positive awareness of Silktide since 2011 when I was despairing at how the UK was going to implement the &amp;quot;Cookie Law&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They really stood out as a voice of reason who were not afraid to hold the bureaucratic power of the ICO to account. The BBC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19505835&quot;&gt;covered them&lt;/a&gt;. They were right. It did nothing to protect users and made web usability worse until it was quietly abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen quite a bit of their public content and I connect with their approach. Perhaps because I lived close to their UK base, but equally I like the way the US side of their company does their training videos too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a part of the tool and although incomplete at the moment of this recording, they are short, clear, and to me, &amp;quot;spot on&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel their focus leans more toward making us better designers by helping us find empathy rather than the dull legislative finger-wagging side of accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessibility-checker&quot;&gt;Accessibility checker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not the best way to think about accessibility, but the first thing I want to know with any checker is do I pass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does an automated test looking at WCAG 2.1 AA, the present &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; standard that will become a legal requirement for many serving the EU next year. You can easily swap that to AAA, the &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot; standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this runs over 200 tests, but of course no accessibility test is definitive. What I quite like is you can switch to the Assisted mode where it will prompt you to look further and use some judgment. Even so, there are limits to how a tool like this can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, with help from this checker I can easily get the No Script Show&#39;s presently basic site to pass on 2.1 AAA, but I can&#39;t pat myself on the back for this accessibility excellence. We have video content that does not include a sign language version, which the checker cannot know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, where our site fails is with a decision I discussed before in an earlier video regarding links opening in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I did all the time before, but I decided that breaking the back button was really only justifiable on pages where there was media that would be disrupted if the user clicked to a new page. To hint that the link is to an external resource, I added an icon which was a suggestion from an article from the Wave accessibility tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silktide&#39;s accessibility checker made me realize I completely forgot non-sighted users and gave me some options, handy code snippets, and a link to the relevant WC3 document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;empathy-building-simulators&quot;&gt;Empathy building simulators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three simulators that help us empathize with the experience of others: dyslexia (which some thought I had), color blindness, and impaired vision. I like that the color blindness simulator gives the percentage of those affected (I had an extension for this but it never added that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;heading-order&quot;&gt;Heading order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section is heading order. Setting these up in a sensible hierarchy is now drummed into me, but it easily slips up in a large document and this is easier to see than in code. Also, as screen reader users may navigate with the &amp;quot;h&amp;quot; key, you get a sense of whether the header text alone explains the page (as a sighted user, I often do a quick scan over the header sections before committing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;landmarks&quot;&gt;Landmarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen readers automatically assign these, so we don&#39;t see them in the code unless we specifically assign them with roles. We can check if they have got it right against the W3C definition example the tool links to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I have gotten familiar with NVDA announcing these, I was not really familiar with the concept and we&#39;ll certainly be looking to use these where needed from here on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t say who, but I used this to look at a well-known site that is going through a redesign and has plenty of accessibility-focused followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had not made use of specific landmarks to separate content into &amp;quot;regions&amp;quot; and sometimes &amp;quot;complementary&amp;quot; sections where to me that would have made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-order&quot;&gt;Focus order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us an order map of a tabbing order. The site I thought might be approved with the use of regions certainly has quite a disorientating tabbing order where the user jumps sharply up and down the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is probably worth testing with Silktide&#39;s fake Uni site that has numerous accessibility issues baked in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fake-university.com&quot;&gt;fake-university.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its homepage, the focus order looks OK at first glance until we see what comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;alt-text&quot;&gt;Alt text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offers a nice overlay of the alt text tags on a page. Those with empty alt tags get labeled as &amp;quot;decorative&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice touch was seeing that in the sidebar it had picked up on hidden images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth watching the short video that warns of over or under-describing images. With AI tools starting to automate this, I can see limited or non-sighted users getting the contextual information they require replaced with irrelevant flowery prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;screen-reader-extras&quot;&gt;Screen Reader Extras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NVDA we can blank out the visual screen. It is just quicker to do here. Certainly, I am going to challenge myself to do this more often as it is quite a different experience when you can&#39;t see how to navigate the screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having mostly worked with WebAim&#39;s Wave checker, I like that I can see and check dark and light modes which can be structurally different. I think that has brought me full circle to my last video. It&#39;s almost as if I planned these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do use it, please try to show your appreciation to Silktide with reviews. Helping them is likely to see this tool getting even more love.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m the ultimate dark and light theme toggle switch… and so’s my wife.</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/10/" />
    <updated>2024-05-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/10/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;toggles-should-be-a-browser-feature&quot;&gt;Toggles should be a browser feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of designing the No Script Show&#39;s website I talked &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/learn/9&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; about light and dark themes and briefly on adding a toggle switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&#39;m looking more closely at the implementation and sharing some alternative code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skimmed over this topic before because it was getting far away from what our show is about (i.e. how easy it&#39;s becoming to make effective sites with only modern HTML and CSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I encountered doing this led away from this and to me strongly agreeing with Bramus Van Damme (a Developer Relations Engineer at Google) that these per-site toggle switches &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bram.us/2022/05/25/dark-mode-toggles-should-be-a-browser-feature/&quot;&gt;should be a browser feature.&lt;/a&gt; This was something &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-adding-per-website-dark-mode-safari/&quot;&gt;rumoured&lt;/a&gt; to be coming to Safari a few years back around the time Bramus was raising this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would like to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bram.us/2024/04/13/what-if-you-had-real-control-over-light-mode-dark-mode-on-a-per-site-basis/&quot;&gt;Bramus and Luke Warlow&#39;s &amp;quot;proof of concept&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; Chrome extension getting more attention to show browser vendors that the demand is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at how complex it can become for non programmers to implement a dark/light switch properly I think it makes their case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern CSS makes it easy for us to create dark and light themes with CSS color-scheme and the &amp;quot;prefers-color-scheme&amp;quot; media query to honour a users system preference. But in giving us this it creates the demand to offer this option via a toggle on our own individual sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this creates a dependency back to custom javaScript and we have to either duplicate our dark and light theme code or in the case of javaScript failure have to ignore the user&#39;s system preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to compromise when working with dark and light images (which I will cover next time on this mini-site ) and we have additional accessibility considerations which I am focussing on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ultimate-theme-toggle&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Theme Toggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code I am using here comes from Salma Alam-Naylor&#39;s (slightly tongue in cheek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/best-light-dark-mode-theme-toggle-javascript/&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Theme Toggle™️&lt;/a&gt; . Equally I could have gone with Adam Argyle&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/patterns/theming/theme-switch&quot;&gt;Dark and Light Theme Switch&lt;/a&gt; shared on Google&#39;s web.dev and used on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://nerdy.dev/&quot;&gt;personal site too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve made some additions to Salma&#39;s code which I have included in the article that goes with the video and we explain them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also been looking at two other dark and light switches from to two other developers I admire: [Una Kravets](https://una.im/ target=) personal site and CSS in real life by &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-irl.info/&quot;&gt;Michelle Barker&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are similar to what I shared before. They all use a HTML button for the switch, they all try to honour the user system preference first and use the browser&#39;s local storage to hold changes in preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure why all chose a button over a checkbox input used on some other solutions. I doubted the semantics of my own button choice. It&#39;s probably irrelevant, but even here we have division on how to do a two option switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Barker&#39;s CSS in real life site is closest to what I shared before in that it has a default light theme and the javaScript adds a class selectors for the dark theme styles. She goes one step further in adding duplicate CSS in a “prefers-color-scheme” media query so it still works if javaScript fails or is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with Bramus and Luke&#39;s chrome extension checking that light and dark themes are working properly in all situations is a pain. We have to keep clearing local storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://noscript.show/img/local-storage.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of where the local storage is on Chromium browsers. That is the appications tab and local storage.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three are different in that they use data attributes: [data-theme=&amp;quot;light&amp;quot;] and [data-theme=&amp;quot;dark&amp;quot;] instead of a CSS class selector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As browsers might support a media query for “no preference” I can see the sense in grouping themes like this rather than having a default and an alternative, but, of course, what&#39;s best depends on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-icons&quot;&gt;Adding icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salma gives us all the code we need on Codepen but the text version without icons. On her own site she adds icons as decorative background images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not something I will say often, but I went with the Chat GPT suggestions to add these icons to the button&#39;s HTML via the javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be OTT as Salma Javascript provides a nice dynamic aria label that explains the button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My addition allows the screen reader users to hover over the icons and hear what they are and what they do, via the icon alt tags (which are also dynamic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other 3 sites mentioned have SVG&#39;s hard coded into the buttons so there are no alt tags there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they wanted the icons announced they could have added an aria labelledby that reference to a title added to the SVG. They have not, which does leaves me thinking I have over complicated this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use my version so you don&#39;t need to add the icons via CSS you could remove them from screen readers by adding aria-hidden=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; to the icons (only shown in the video so I don&#39;t forget)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toggles-suck&quot;&gt;Toggles suck!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to get into UI here. There&#39;s a lot of articles about the usability of toggle switches. This one called toggles suck seems to do a good job of bringing together what others have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d rather see the best people in accessibility working with browser vendors to create a convention we all could understand and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan&#39;s impression was that side to side toggling had become the norm. He could be right, certainly there was a run off fancy Codepen toggles like that, but here there are all single icons ( Adam and Una both have cool SVG animation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll go with the least attention grabbing and space saving approach as there are probably better things for the visitor to get focussed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-javascript&quot;&gt;No javascript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Salma&#39;s code we set a fallback theme in the HTML if javaScript fails: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot; data-theme=&amp;quot;light&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user device preference is not honoured (unless that matches what we have set.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal sites for the others they have duplicated the CSS That is, they have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt; @media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
/* All the light rules*/
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;[data-theme=&quot;light&quot;]{
/* All the light rules again*/
} &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want the same we need to add some additional JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Inline script to set the initial theme based on system preference or local storage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; localStorageTheme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; localStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;theme&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; systemPrefersDark &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;matchMedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;matches&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; theme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; localStorageTheme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; localStorageTheme &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;systemPrefersDark &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;dark&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;light&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;documentElement&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;data-theme&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; theme&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got Chat GPT to do this. It&#39;s probably best to let the browser read this first. I have to put this in the head. Also I have to place the prefers-color-scheme media queries first in the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will probably stick with Salma&#39;s approach. The CSS duplication seems fine for a few colours, but if you get into swapping icons and images based on dark and light preference the code and maintenance starts adding up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-js-no-toggle&quot;&gt;No JS - no toggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have altered Salma&#39;s code to hide the toggle when there is no JS. The button has an inline style of &lt;code&gt;display:none;&lt;/code&gt;which is changed to &lt;code&gt;display:block;&lt;/code&gt; by the javaScript. This removes it from the accessibility tree for screen readers too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-state&quot;&gt;Focus state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier video I mentioned the new focus-visible pseudo class to let the browser remove ugly focus rings when a sighted user does not need this visual clue. This is generally one to go for, but here we have an exception as the button here is not being styled in the regular way and we need people to tab to it and change it with the keyboard. I added it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:focus-visible:not(toggle)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;             
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Styles */&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toggle-animation&quot;&gt;Toggle Animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t have much animation here, but still I have added &lt;code&gt;@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)&lt;/code&gt;to this so it only shows for people who do not set this to reduced or no motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;aria-live&quot;&gt;Aria Live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally noticed on Adam Argyles&#39;s personal site and also Una Kravets they had added &lt;code&gt;aria-live=&amp;quot;polite&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. It&#39;s not included in Adams web dev article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aria live gives screen readers an update of regional changes they might not otherwise be aware of because the reader is focused elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example if a checkout form has an input to add something that will alter the price positioned elsewhere in the region the changed price will be announced (politely) when the input is checked. It&#39;s likely that sighted users would be looking at price when clicking elsewhere and this brings this ability to non sighted users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying it with the NVDA (an open source screen reader that is also the most used) I felt adding this might be annoying or even more confusing in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I enter in light mode without aria live the screen reader announces &amp;quot;switch to dark theme button&amp;quot; if I enter or click it says &amp;quot;switch to light theme&amp;quot;. I Imagine most would understand what&#39;s happening on the first change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also If hover over the icon it says it is a sun icon that switches to a dark theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I add aria live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvaccess.org/&quot;&gt;NVDA&lt;/a&gt; says switch to light theme 3 times and automatically reads the new alt image tag too. It could be my ignorance using NVDA, but I did not like how it worked with my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get a toggle to work well pushed me beyond my skill set and toward feeling less certain in what I am doing. I think that alone backs up Bramus’s argument for browsers to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As dark and light themes become increasingly becoming a standard I’d rather be focussing on doing better designs with the same CSS as everyone rather than going it alone with my own custom JS hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel more sure of this after seeing a couple of these switches made for the massive WordPress audience that have not taken anything the care the people I feature here have. Previously, I would have excitedly jumped on these taking it for granted that I was aiding accessibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I don&#39;t think this is as bad as the way things went with the accessibility overlays market (which I am sure was well intended originally) but, I think some early standards might avoid a similar thing happening . Rant over!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s new in web images. Are they worth a thousand words?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/11/" />
    <updated>2024-05-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/11/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-css&quot;&gt;New CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit&quot;&gt;Object fit&lt;/a&gt; which resized images to fit its container. The cover value is particularly useful as you can responsively crop the image to the available space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;Aspect ratio.&lt;/a&gt; There is no need to hack this with calc anymore. On our site we needed the YouTube thumbnail images (and iframe)to remain at 16:9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image&quot;&gt;Border image.&lt;/a&gt;It can do more than images to borders. A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article shows what can be done to enhance or replace images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter&quot;&gt;Filter:&lt;/a&gt;Blur, brightness, contrast, drop-shadow, hue rotate, invert, grayscale, saturate, sepia and opacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path&quot;&gt;Clip-path&lt;/a&gt; to clip out images to shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image&quot;&gt;Mask-image&lt;/a&gt; Images masking images. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_masking.asp&quot;&gt;Example.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter&quot;&gt;Backdrop-filter.&lt;/a&gt; Limited support. Mostly useful for blurring an image where you place text over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; There is the still experimental prefers-reduced-data media query to get rid of non essential images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is that images are inline elements. We have to tame them with a CSS reset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;img, picture, svg, video&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; block&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;max-inline-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 100%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; auto&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-css-revisited&quot;&gt;Old CSS revisited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML Img tag v CSS background img. Meaningful content vs decorative. Which is a logo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt tags. For screen readers rather than SEO boasting. Using blank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-html&quot;&gt;New HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading=&amp;quot;lazy/eager&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Hints: fetchpriority=&amp;quot;high/low&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-html-revisited&quot;&gt;Old HTML revisited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;picture&gt; is easily forgotten. It allows for &amp;quot;art direction&amp;quot; - showing a range of image sources depending on the media query (such as viewport size or light/dark preference).&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;srcset serves a range of images based on viewport size and/or pixel density. We need something better as CMS&#39;s can never automate these efficently and manual writing and image cropping is overwhelmingly time consuming and messy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/&quot;&gt;This tool helps&lt;/a&gt;. Responsive images fail us with container queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;. The element that marks up a photo in a document has &lt;figcaption&gt; to define a caption for the photo.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a question. If we build for not visual consumption should every image that is not marked as a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; be background image?&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things like this in HTML. See this &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/a-call-for-consensus-on-html-semantics/&quot;&gt;post by Stephanie Eckles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-formats&quot;&gt;New formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webp (widely available 98%) and AVIF (newly available 93%) mostly solves the old problem of which is suitable for the type of image (jpg, gif or png).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVGs goes back to 1999. V2 from 2018. There are future proof, good for usabilty and SEO (if labelled corretly) and we can do some amazing thing with SVG filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-a-bitmap-picture-worth-a-thousand-words&quot;&gt;Is a bitmap picture worth a thousand words?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser processes time and the environmental cost is high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to serve 320px (if we ignore watches) to 7680 px screens efficiently is not easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we overloaded with stock and AI images that trust has been eroded to the point we try to block them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS&#39;s in their attempt to help quickly fill up our server space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, it can be a struggle to get a decent picture of a clients even when it could be the only picture a visitor cares about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-css-media-features&quot;&gt;New CSS media features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently there&#39;s W3C specifications for 6 CSS media features that allow our design to respond to a user&#39;s browser or device preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included below is the global browser support as of April 2024 from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;Can I use&lt;/a&gt; site and the year when the feature was supported in the core browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;Prefers-color-scheme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors&quot;&gt;Forced-colors*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast&quot;&gt;Prefers-contrast:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2022 - 97%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; experimental - 68%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; experimental - 0%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* An example of a forced colour mode is Windows High Contrast mode where you might want to provide an alternative to subtleties like box shadows to mark out an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;statistics-on-user-preferences&quot;&gt;Statistics on user preferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on user behaviour is not easy to find, but we can look at Chrome&#39;s data on the percentage of features included on the pages they crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3581&quot;&gt;PreferredColorSchemeDarkSetting&lt;/a&gt;- 32%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3870&quot;&gt;Forced-colors&lt;/a&gt; 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3869&quot;&gt;Prefers-contrast&lt;/a&gt; 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4364&quot;&gt;Reduced motion&lt;/a&gt; 0.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4635&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-transparency&lt;/a&gt; 0.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefers-reduced-data: no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-extra-info-on-dark-mode&quot;&gt;Some extra info on dark mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://earthweb.com/how-many-people-use-dark-mode/#How_Many_People_Use_Dark_Mode_in_2023&quot;&gt;Earthweb&lt;/a&gt; says 81.9% of smartphone users use dark mode and that 64.6% expect websites to apply dark mode automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://helpfultech.net/dark-mode-usage-statistics-2024.html&quot;&gt;Helpfultech&lt;/a&gt; says after 10 p.m., about 82.7% of users put their phones in dark mode, revealing a particular usage trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean-for-designers&quot;&gt;What does this mean for designers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client resistance to anything not visually on brand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost and relative returns on implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concerns about the tech being in its infancy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responding to a user&#39;s preferences may allow better control on branding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with accessibility the cost of not implementing these (progressive enhancements) at build time could be more costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech moves fast. For example if browsers implemented an easy dark/light toggle how quickly would site want a dark/light mode?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers and device vendors have a powerful influence over the web. Now these are in the W3C&#39;s specifications and growing we may not need proof of the direction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software and skills. Today we’re talking about the new CSS media queries that let us design unique experiences according to the preferences website visitors set in their browser or device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is relatively new and increasingly popular, but it also challenges the way we have traditionally approached web design. So David. Are you feeling challenged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ve been really challenged actually. a little while back I did a, short video on light and dark mode and it opened up so much about being able to, or actually in our case, not being able to use, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some of the new CSS properties for that. yeah. But we did agree though that you would not call me challenge, but call me special from now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You are special,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; David. Okay. that’s absolutely fine by me. I guess the interesting thing here is that we really are heading into a new era where it’s possible for the person viewing the webpage to have some sort of, some ability to change various things in the past until almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say now what is what you get. dear viewer, I’m gonna serve you up a website and this is what you’re gonna see. But now we’ve got the option to, to interact with that a little bit, which makes life a little bit more interesting, maybe a little bit more challenging. Shall I show our webpage so that we can begin this episode properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. The show notes. I agree. we started this show really, I guess on the premise that, Everything had changed and we were looking at intrinsic design and we were looking at how we had to give up the idea that we would be setting our designs to some fixed width or something. It had to be squishy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this is, on a similar vein, we now have to give up the idea that perhaps we’re choosing the colors that everybody’s gonna get or even the interactions, So I think, we’re having to get a little bit more abstract all the time, or a little bit more removed away from traditional, print design all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I guess SAS apps and things like that have had bits of this for a while, haven’t they? you’ve been able to tweak the way that, so for example, Facebook looks in certain ways and what have you. but it’s coming under the banner of user preferences and the idea being that anybody can decide a whole bunch of different things, and it’s not just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the light and dark mode, although that was covered in the previous episode nine. By the way, if you want to follow the show notes for this, our website is no script show and then you just append the number of the episode after the forward slash So this will be, episode 10, so it’s no script show, slash 10, and you can see that on the screen right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shall we begin with these new CSS media features then? Yes, we’ve got six of ’em&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and we’ve listed them here. And the first one we know about because that’s what we’ve just been talking about, which is prefers color scheme, where we can set things to dark or light mode so we can do a separate design for dark and light with this, and perhaps in the future, certainly in the spec for no preference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we could have three alternatives. Plus what we regularly will theme, So we’ve got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got, can I just pause you there just for one moment? So I can see that we’ve got a link here, which is, we’ll probably click on in a minute, but you’ve got this supported in 2020 and that comes from, can I use, and then what’s this, 96% that’s next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it seems like quite a high. Yeah. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, for those, yeah. So this is, can I use, has given us the percentage rounded up. I haven’t put the dots. Something, as it presently stands where we’re in April, 2024. so that’s, the browsers who. supporting these different features. So yeah, 96% and of course it’s higher with, can I use, if we look just at the UK or us with that, and I’ve put supported since 2020 because that’s when all the core browsers we were talking about, baseline before, and it, would it meet all of those core browsers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next one, shall we just, we will list them all out, shall we? One is, yeah. Let’s list them out and then explore. Yeah. Is preferred reduced motion where we can decide whether we are going to include some of the animations that we might put into, whether we just make animations, something that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only those people who are specifically not set a preference for. I think, again, this is pretty similar statistics on this one. So it’s again, at 96% been supported in the core browser since 2020. And we have forced colors, which I oddly I didn’t even know about this one. Nope. And no, and this again, it’s been out for the same length of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has the same can I use and. It appears to be used quite a lot, but it’s, referring to, or at least the MDN records gives us something. An example of it might be Windows High Contrast Mode, where if somebody set that up, then we might need to have some other styling. So for example. And it’s the one that they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it will make all the drop shadows, the subtle drop shadows evaporate. So if we wanted to section out an area, we might need to put a clear border around it for those people who have chosen to have a, false color with a theme,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I. And is this something that’s, ’cause I noticed you’ve got a little asterisk next to that one, which then is highlighted, be below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gave an example of Windows, high contrast Mode. Now I’m not familiar with that because I have a Mac. is that some sort of setting that you set up in Windows to say, I, for the eyesight that I’ve got, I would prefer everything to be really of, a high contrast across the whole os.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not just in the browser, it’s on everything that Windows shows you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what, this is where I’m a bit under prepared with this one. Okay. Because I do know there are some themes that you can put on, ’cause I, played around with those and there’s a really kind of high contrast theme I think in there as I understand it, that you could just pick, there are other ones, so you could just overwrite basic colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it is that, okay, that’s okay. It’s one to explore. It’s okay. Yeah. There’s things, for us to learn as well. Okay. Okay. And there’s also prefers contrast as well, which may be a separate setting on, that one. So, we’ve got the, oh, sorry, I’ve skipped over one here. I’m looking at other notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve got force colors, which is asterisk, which is the one where that could apply when someone set up a theme that would make sense and prefers contrast, which I believe is a setting that you might choose. To go across all boards, without a theme if you like. Okay. So I think that’s the separation between those two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they, sorry, can I just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; drill down into that? So forced colors is, where you, are enforcing a predetermined set of colors that, that, you want to be there and prefers contrast is a bit more ephemeral. It’s a bit, okay. we want high contrast, but we’re not specifying the color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. I think that’s the case. Yeah. We should have been a bit more prepared with this one, but I do know there’s themes in windows where you could force those kind of colors, and I think the height prefers contrast is just a setting that you might just generally want in the same way that you have setting that increases your font size across, The board uhhuh. and then we’ve got re prefers reduced transparency. Oh, I didn’t cover the contrast. That’s at, 97%. Yeah. And again, this is supported a bit later. That’s 2022 prefers reduced transparency. It’s still experimental. But, it’s only not supported in Firefox and Safari as we’re talking about this, so it’s still got a 68%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use? you can, people are still using that. And what that is totally experimental is the last one, which is prefers reduced data. And that’s only available behind a flag, I think in Chrome. Okay. Or edge. Edge and, odd, oddly opera, which isn’t counted as one of the core. So they’ve all got it ready to go behind a flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, the reduced data is. A way of us being able to say someone slicks that as their preference. Then how we might honor that might be by. Not loading some custom fonts, being able to just use, say, fonts instead. So if they’ve chosen that we, don’t load that or we don’t load some big images or video or something like that, or serve something as an alternative to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; shall we just very quickly dip into each of these links one at a time and just read the top paragraph? ’cause it might even educate us. Yeah, sure. Bits that we missed, okay. So we’re gonna go for the first one, which is prefer. Prefers color scheme, and we’re gonna end up on the M-D-M-M-D-N web docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it says here, the prefers color scheme CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has requested light or dark color theme. So it’s binary, on or off. A user indicates their preference through an operating system setting. EG light and dark mode. I don’t know if you have ever implemented this, but I’ve got dark mode set across the board on every device that I own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly recent development for me, and it’s largely born out of my lack of battery life on a phone. That was the first thing that Dr. Drove it and I realized that I was saving. Battery by having the black screen instead of the light screen, ’cause you’re not like illuminating the pixels. And it made a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I started to explore what it was like on the Mac, and then I started to hear all sorts of things about, the environmental impact because it’s using less battery power. Is there is an impact on that and it’s in, on my Mac. it works. Some things, are obviously not honoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll probably see some things in a moment that don’t honor it, but on the whole, as you can see here, I don’t know if you’ve got yours switched off. This webpage to me looks like this. It’s black over where you are. Have you got this as black or as white? If you don’t have that switched on. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I have no preference set, so I get white and I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if I set it to light as well. So there is one thing in that, that it actually is not a complete spec because it does give us an option to put in some code that we’re going to have to start it for people who set it to dark, to set it specifically to light. but light and no preference tend to go together at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the future, there may be spec four. it’s not supported in the browsers at the moment, but for no preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. alright. Okay, let’s go to the next one then. But that was, gave us a bit of an overview. So this is prefers reduced motion. I think you covered that probably. but it says here, the prefers reduced motion CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has enabled a setting on their device to minimize the amount of non-essential motion setting is used to convey to the browser on the device that the user prefers an interface that removes, reduces or replaces motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based animations, and I know that there are some people that I know who really suffer when they look at animations on websites that it actually causes something akin to, being on a fairground ride or something like that. You either get this real sense of nausea from it. I, do not have this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could watch any amount of motion on a screen and it wouldn’t interfere with me at all. But I know that this really does make people feel quite unwell, which is. Which is interesting. anything to add to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, nothing but people can have it temporarily where they, often something with an ear infection can throw out people’s balance and they find it very difficult then to cope with anything that’s moving around on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But that’s a really interesting one that there’s, a medical aspect to that. Yeah. Which is you can very rarely say that about, web design, that they’re gonna have some impact on people’s actual, physical state. Okay. Forced colors. Let’s just run through these quickly. I. Forced colors, is used to detect if the user agent has enabled a forced colors mode where it enforces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are a user chosen limited color palette on the page. An example of a forced colors mode is windows high contrast mode. Okay, shall I move on to the next one? Okay, just quickly nipping through these prefers contrast, is used to detect whether the user has requested the web content to be presented with a lower or higher contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m a little bit unsure about what the actual difference with forced and prefers is. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I, think, I got it right. Just having a quick Google search here does look like on the contrast themes that you can have. So I think the force colors is because the force schemes will force their own color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. On the, okay. and I think the high contrast is simply just a, generally boosting up your contrast across all sites, but generally it will deliver. Got it. Got it. The site as it is where the, themes, I think as I’ve only tested it out once and it was a very uncomfortable experience when I put it on one of their dark themes, I put it on, it was difficult to, for me to view some of the websites because,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; they did, we’ve gone for subtlety a lot more these days. We have these kind of drop shadows to mark out little areas and we think that’s really wonderful, but they just obliterated. As soon as you go into one of these themes, you just, Yeah. You can’t tell what the area is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. So that’s, highlighted that. So we know that one is a bit more profound than the other, let’s put it that way. Okay. prefers reduced transparency, is used to detect if a user has enabled a setting on their device to reduce. The transparent or translucent layer effects used on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching on such a setting can help improve contrast and readability for some users. Okay. Anything to add to that, or shall I go on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, nothing. We do use a lot of opacity on things, and again, it’s this sort of subtlety, which, you know. Some people just can’t see it, can they? So they want that reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yep. And then this one, which is prefers reduced data, is used to detect if a user requested that web content consumes less internet traffic. And obviously the links you’ll be able to find on the show notes and, really we’ve just. Literally scratch the surface because each of these pages will give you information not only about where it’s supported, but how to implement it along with code snippets and, what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there they are on no script show slash 10. Okay. So should we move on from there or do you want to explore that more? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s, some extra statistics that, let’s talk about the statistics. ’cause there isn’t much available If we want to know about a user’s behavior, as far as I know, I’d love it if somebody told me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can, and we’ve listed out the, Google’s own data, which is, what is browser is finding are features that have been included on the pages that they crawled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so are you basically saying that the number that we’re showing on the screen, so this one for example, is showing 32%. They’re saying that on 32% of the websites that they’re crawling, they’ve detected this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody has implemented, gosh. 32% that. Wow. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. And it doesn’t, really surprise me actually now because I’ve just become aware after a long time of not that dark is quite popular. More than I thought. But actually the next one, so our forced colors, which is, if we’ve got it right, is all about people who are choosing a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that people are. According to Crows, if we’ve understood it correctly, the 27% of people, so 27%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; percent of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; websites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; or pages, right? So 20% of shipped websites, things that you can go and browse on the internet, have the capability to force. You can. You can. Yeah. Or, to they honor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You know they’re going to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. That’s a better way of saying it. Yeah. Nice. Wow, that’s actually staggering. Yeah. I would’ve thought that number would’ve been in the low single digits. Yeah. but that just shows essentially what a, bad web, a bad website designer I am, these things have gotten lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and yet there they are. 27% of websites have been shipped with this so that it can be honored. Sorry, of inter, so anyway, I should say preferred color scheme, dark setting. That was 32% forced colors, 27%. You carry on down the list if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and the next one is preferred contrast coming in at 14% or 14% of pages that they crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have some code in there that is honoring that. contrast preference, reduced motion. Now we drop down quite a lot to, 0.5%. For that, and that’s rounding up on that one. So that isn’t being used much ’cause it’s newer and not so well supported, Prefers reduced transparency. We’ve got 0.4% and finally we’ve got nothing for prefers reduced data because it’s experimental and it’s only behind flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I love what you’ve written there. Prefers reduced data. No data. that’s ideal. That’s the way it should be. but okay. That shows a precipitous drop. So the, color, the col, the bits and pieces with the coloring of the website, the dark, the light. The force color, the prefers contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s, been taken up. that is started to ship and is now, it’s getting to be in the sort of high 30, sorry, the, low thirties in some cases, but the motion ones. The transparency one. In this case real. This is new. Nobody’s going for that yet, but we know at least that it’s available in most of the browsers so it could start to become an important topic in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’m surprised the reduced motion isn’t supported so much because it’s been around for quite a while in terms of the call support and in my circles, it seems to be talked about quite a lot about using animation and an awareness generally of accessibility and wanting to, not give people problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m surprised that’s a low. I hope we’re interpreting these figures, but there’s not much on it from the users. Point of view, knowing user’s behavior. The, we’ve only got, if you like, what fellow developers are putting into their code as some indication about what’s growing and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I guess the motion one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to think of my recent browsing history, and I am really struggling to think of something that I’ve looked at in the last week where there was any animation at all. Ah, the majority of where I end up, so it’s newspapers, it’s web design, tutorials, things like that. There isn’t anything in that I can think of as animation, so I just wonder if.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about let’s, should we just not bother with animation? Because is it really needed? I wonder if that message is coming across and so people are just not implementing it because there’s not a lot to implement. There’s not a lot to switch on or switch off ’cause they’ve foregone the option to have animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I’m pure guesswork. Yeah, it’s a really good point because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think people are more conscious about adding it, but I thought it might be included. even on. Our site. There’s a bit of animation. In fact, if you would go to the, there’s a little back to the top scroll button, and if you click on it, it animates, scrolls up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, in fact, you could probably do it if you scroll down on there. Scroll down to the bottom. to the bottom, just right there. Click that. Yeah. Yeah. And that’s, there it is. scrolling up with some animation. Now actually, if you had your preference set, it wouldn’t do that because I actually have included the code already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, if it’s, only there, if there’s no preference, if you said that you don’t want motion, it’ll go so to the top. Straight to the top, right? So I imagine even if you are right, which I think is interesting, that’s probably coming into play as well. But I think simple things like that are often built into a lot of sites, and I would suspect it’s one of those things where you would want to use this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get rid of that for those people. Yeah. Specifically don’t want any animation, but, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I just ask you, because I know that you are implementing some of these bits and pieces, and it might be curious for the, listener or the, the viewer depending on where you come in. so how, are you actually implementing that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you mentioned that you put in the code for the, let’s say, reduced motion. Yeah. what does that look like? Where does it sit? How complicated is that to implement? And also how does the user actually set it? How do you, as a user of webpages, how do you say, I want no motion, please. How do you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to put that in your. I don’t know if it’s in the browser settings. I think this has to be in your device for this. It is just showing how little we are prepared for this. in terms of me being able to implement it, it’s very easy. I just need to put that in this particular media query. In fact, now you put me on the spot ’cause I’m just quickly trying to search now for my code on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s okay. We can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; probably go to the, oh look, isn’t that interesting? The MDN pages, which we showed a moment ago, respected my dark mode, but the Chrome platform status page, which we just clicked on, has not, it’s decided to show me it, in white. So yeah. Okay. That’s, that’s interesting. Sorry, I was buying you a bit of time there, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s no good ’cause I still haven’t found it in my code, but it was a very simple thing to just wrap that in. basically I think I put it in a media query that was saying, has no preference, then put the scroll animation in there. and that’s, it’s as simple as that, but that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the purpose of today wasn’t to explain how to do it, it was more to illustrate the fact that these things are, available and, yeah, become more important in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however, they are, discovered by the user browsing the website. Do you wanna go on to, the bit at the bottom about more dark mode, or have you got more to say on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, no, I, think that’s it. I think I was right with, it’s a device only rather than a browser that you can set for no motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I could be wrong on that. Maybe browsers will start introducing that. yeah, there is some extra information ’cause that’s all we could really find about users’ behavior rather developers. And we’ve got a couple of quotes and I dunno how reliable they are, but you can go and check ’em out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve got earth, web. Who are saying, maybe you can read that out there. Yeah, so Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Web, the, website there, a quote that David’s found is, 81.9%, they call it 82% of smartphone users use dark mode. And that 65%, 64.6 expects expect websites to apply dark mode automatically. That figure. Seems so far skewed to that side with the experience that I have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. so I’m not gonna contest whether it’s valid or not. I’m sure that they’ve done the, polling and the research, but if I was to tell you about the people that I’ve interacted with over the last week or month. Almost nobody on their mobile device that I know has, even an inclination of what dark mode or light mode is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and everything is just in the default that the, the device ships with. but I know for my part, I have implemented that. So I am in that 65% there. but they seem surprisingly high to me. Yeah, and I’ve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; seen another, about specifically looking to people like us, people who build sites or developers, and that kind of, then it’s really high eighties, maybe even reaching nineties that I’ve seen of people who prefer dark mode, which of course is something that if you work is something like VS code to do the actual coding, you’re gonna get a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, I don’t know anybody who codes these days in. a light mode. But, so yeah, it is a surprising statistic. the only, I’ve only got one other site which went out last year where I’ve implemented dark mode and I thought we’re moving towards this. I keep hearing more and more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I’ve got all I’ve got to go on as the statistics from that is my own observations by looking at Microsoft’s clarity. Where does screen recordings? Yeah. So that’s the only thing. And I have looked through, hundreds of these screen recordings over the time and my. Estimate would be somewhere over 10% have come in and, but probably still under 20% have come in on dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, to this point, I, there’s a toggle to this point. I haven’t seen anyone swap. Use that to swap their preference. Interesting enough. Interesting. But the, but that’s much lower than what you would hear. there’s various statistics on this about promoting dark mode, which are always high, but it’s, that’s quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I think about it, that would be expected because this website we know is for. middle-aged people plus who are in the UK and primarily coming in on desktops. yeah. Yeah. So I think it’s skewed to the lower end naturally, if our, an anecdotal evidence is that it’s a big trending thing, I think amongst people, younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, from the mobiles. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, that’s an interesting point. So the demographics, the age, demographics in particular might be playing a part. Also, I, we were talking before we hit record, there isn’t really a, apart from doing it in the os, so on Mac, os, windows or Android or iOS, where you can set this up and you hope that the, the browser inherits that there isn’t really yet a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal way of doing this within a website. There, there’s this kind of toggle thing, which I’m seeing more. So top right there’s a little slider, essentially it’s a little toggle button that goes right, yeah. Or left. And it’s got a picture symbol of a moon, symbol of a sun. And you switch it on and off, but that’s not everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on some, even some big websites, even governmental websites, you don’t see it. So there isn’t yet this thing. Sometimes it’s buried in the footer. There’s no universal way of doing it. And actually I do wonder how reluctant people would, let’s say we set on the toggle in the top right. I do wonder how willing web developers will be and companies will be to give up that much real estate in the most important bit of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that toggle, because that’s where your, I don’t know, your contact us button goes or maybe your logo or something like that. So anyway, time will tell. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll just quickly cover this other from Helpful Tech. They say after 10:00 PM about 82.7, percent of users put their phone into dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I think that’s interesting because, my only real experience with. Technology that kind of automatically does that is sat navs. they, yeah, they tend to do that. And, I think, yeah, that’s probably very likely. I, you touched on something which I covered in my short video, before that, and we were, we’ve been talking about this on, I guess we should bring it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is, As I was trying to implement our light and dark mode for the, redesign of the site, I decided that we must have a toggle because it’s okay honoring those preferences that are set in someone’s device or their browser, but they may not always want it, and if they have got it set, they might not like the dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve given someone right, right on your site, and they may at different points in the day. Or different types of content want to swap. So we end up with the toggle and suddenly we have a dilemma because something which we could do with CSS, honor those people’s preferences if we want to toggle them. It, you’re gonna have to do that on a page by page basis to make the CSS that we’ve been given work. And that’s a terrible experience. So we then end up using JavaScript to store site-wide disc, preference that you’ve set, so you can turn it off and know it’s there and have the control. So we get into this and then this becomes an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a Google employee called Bramos Van Dam. It’s not in the notes here, but he has put forward a little test of a. A button that you can have in the browser. He’s been making the argument for a couple of years that this should be, the toggle button, should be a feature on a side by side basis that should be in your browser rather than every website having to reinvent the wheel, put this extra code in,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so the something equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you look on my. screen here. I’ve obviously got A load of chrome extensions here. But to the right of them are, these are browser based things. They look like extensions, but they’re actually coming from the browser. So it’s, toggling on and off the, sidebar and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His suggestion is something like this, right? That you would have a, button maybe up here in the browser and you’d click it. Click it again, on off. Dark mode, like mode, dark mode like mode. And the browser would take on the responsibility of remembering that on the no script show website you want dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you come back you’re just good to go. And that feels nice as well because that could ship, that’s one of the settings that could sync between devices. So if you’ve got Brave, I’m using Brave. if you’re using Brave on a mobile phone and another computer. It would sync that data and be able to transfer it so that your experience is the same wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like the right way of doing it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also, since finding that, I also discovered, and this is some time back, but there is an article in its link below on our other links on the show’s website, but Safari a couple of years back 2022, there was talk coming out that they were considering putting this very thing into Safari browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do think it does seem logical that they will provide this choice. It. Following the people I follow now, a lot of people have implemented light and dark modes and realized on their own designs that just leaving it to a browser or device setting isn’t enough. You need to be able to give people a toggle, and as soon as you get the toggles, you get that extra code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also get another issue with some, logos, and I’ll talk about this in a short video because suddenly you want a light and a dark mode. and you maybe have to serve up again with JavaScript, that, or do it with a background image. But with an SVG, you can include the prefers. Color scheme and you can change your SVG to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So it’d be wonderful if we can just get it down to HTML and CSS being able to, and let the browsers do the toggle for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I guess one of the things is that, so I’m just gonna scroll back up the page. So just in, in this show, we’ve covered, color schemes, reduce motion force colors, contrast transparency data, that’s quite a lot of toggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if that were to be on the website, the whole of. Discuss a whole area of toggles that you’ve gotta toggle on and off, make decisions. And if you just set that up in the browser, you know the, maybe the first time you install it, that’s part of the onboarding experience. do you typically like large light or dark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you typically want reduced motion, et cetera? Then that being handled by the browser, in every case, in every single one of those feels like the right way. To begin that journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I wonder, the light and dark one is because I think it’s come up. all of these things you should be able to find in your device or your browser anyway, the ones that are listed, of course, it’s now with the light and dark on a site by site basis that you decide to, so I, think if you went for no data, you wouldn’t decide that you wanted that on a site by site basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. and the same as contrast. So I think it’s the light and dark mode that stands out as something different where, our behavior dictates that actually we want to be able to choose. yeah. But on a side by side basis, where the others, I’m not sure, I think they could be set in the, I. In your settings then be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. if you do have an issue with motion, then you’ll, want all of your websites. You probably want that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; everywhere. Yeah, exactly. I think that was what I was trying to say. I probably didn’t communicate it very well, but, yeah. Okay, so we’re on the 38 minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall we just wrap up with these pros and cons? Do you wanna go through that of what it means for people working. Building website. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. There was just maybe, I think we’re both agreed on this one, but what we might get, I think it’s worth trying to implement some of these things, but what we might get is the client’s resistance on the con side here of doing anything that’s not visually on brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. that we might be some cost, versus relative returns on implementation if we all have to do and concerns about this is tech in its infancy, which I think when we’re having this debate about the, whether we should be having a switch in our browsers to switch from dark and light mode, I think it shows us how we are in an infancy with that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we were showing in, there’s a lack of data about our actual. Users are behaving. But I think the counter to that, is the thing that I’ve put on the pro, which would be responded to a user’s preferences, would probably allow us to control the branding better, because if users are going to increasingly override it with themes that they get from their browsers because they get used to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or they’re just setting things up, then you lose your control over your branding anyway. You might think it’s fine ’cause it works on yours. So I think it’s a way of doing that. I think when it comes to. the cost of these things. I think it probably as a lot of these fall under accessibility in some form or another, then implementation early on is probably going to save extra cost later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro fitting is more expensive than just doing it at the start. Always. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And I think that’s it. And I think in some ways we, can already see, we didn’t actually look at. Did we look at any of those growing statistics? It does look like everything’s on the growth. We’re moving to a more, user preference based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;web, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Some of the links that we have on this page link to the Chrome documentation and their polling, as we said, the pages, yeah. The graphs are always, inexorably rising up. They don’t seem to be going down. So this is a trend without a doubt. Yeah. Sorry, interruption. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, and I think there’s more people these days who will know about things that are already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browsers are reading mode where you can just wipe out all of the design anyway. So I think people are, getting smarter and I, it does to me, I dunno about you. It feels like with a lot of things we are moving away from, I. How we used to look at the web, particularly, people who paid us to design websites were because they were marking out their space in this new area to do their marketing and print was what everybody knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I think where this moves us a little bit back to the fact that, the web is still, this kind of information sharing platform. Yeah. And we need to provide whatever we are selling within that framework and be part of the general web so we can give. Use us, the experience we have to fit in, if you like, with yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, direction. So I think, yeah, there’s, a big change. that’s it really. there was so much more we could have talked about in this one. I think there’s a bigger debate about the light and dark mode, but, I. I think we, this is probably, we talk long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve certainly supplied information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is pretty clear that there’s a lot that we really don’t know. but it is cutting edge. But I think what we can definitely take out of this is that this is here, it’s available, people are beginning to use it, and in some cases are using it. Not quite as a, majority, but it’s fast approaching a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, and so yeah, go and look at the show notes. Like I said, no script show slash 10 for the 10th episode. You can find all of the links there and go and explore for yourself and start having that conversation with your clients. Are we done? Yeah, we’re done. Yeah. Okay. In which case I’ll say I’ll see you on episode 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks David. Yeah, thank you. Bye-Bye bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does Baseline solve our browser support problems?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/9/" />
    <updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/9/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;browser-support-before-baseline&quot;&gt;Browser support before Baseline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used a web platform where increasingly we passed the handing these considerations to third party builders and themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our local business clients only had bandwidth to care about what their own browser shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a build we may have a panel of experts (nieces and nephews who know about computers and study art at school). After that, the chances of being contacted by a visitor are slim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;evergreen-browsers-and-interoperability&quot;&gt;Evergreen browsers &amp;amp; interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core browsers, Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox are now automatically updating for users on approximately a monthly basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although these updates are up to the vendors that are all signed up to deliver what they jointly agreed to support in terms of the W3C spec for that year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some chose to run ahead with other spec not included in the last agreement. For example view transitions in Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;baseline-finding-and-understanding-it&quot;&gt;Baseline: finding and understanding it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is now rolled out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;Can I Use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/&quot;&gt;Web.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two stages: &lt;strong&gt;Newly available&lt;/strong&gt; - supported by the core browsers and &lt;strong&gt;Widely available&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 months has passed. The feature can be used by most sites without worrying about support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the MDN for Browser compatibility for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid#browser_compatibility&quot;&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; we can see it also includes information on Opera and Samsung which are not core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-baseline-cautiously&quot;&gt;Using Baseline cautiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://molily.de/browser-compatibility-baseline/&quot;&gt;article by Molily&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 where she highlights that the @layer rule was showing as &amp;quot;widely available&amp;quot; when actual support on Can I use was only (then) at 90%. Presumably this was an error as the Baseline for @layer is now set at &amp;quot;newly available&amp;quot;. Still that was quite a lot of people on a breaking feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most refer to is the Can I use site which pulls its data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.statcounter.com/&quot;&gt;Statcounter&lt;/a&gt;. This data comes from 1.5 million+ sites amounting to 5 billion page views per month. It does its best to exclude bots, but it is not clear how successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be interesting filtering the Can I use data by country which most do not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past experience of inconsistent implementation of features, not helped by vendor prefixes (ie -webkit) has probably made the majority cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if not so much new CSS has come out that we have started to work out their power when combined. WordPress may be a good example of the original cautiousness and how that may be changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Baseline partly exists to encourage people to use modern CSS. Who can resist that initial green box full of ticks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graceful-degradation-and-progressive-enhancement&quot;&gt;Graceful degradation &amp;amp; progressive enhancement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graceful degradation:&lt;/strong&gt; building for modern browsers, whilst considering the lesser experience for users of older browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive enhancement:&lt;/strong&gt; starting with a base level for all and adding extras for those modern browsers that support them (an example is the minor use of subgrid on the episode page of our site).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who prefer a more graceful degradation approach there are polyfils (JS to add in the missing features in older browsers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For progressive enhancement we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports&quot;&gt;@support&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;feature query&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-does-this-leave-us&quot;&gt;Where does this leave us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project where we want to feature new CSS and can assume the audience we want to reach will be using modern browsers, Baseline is a good reference for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we may want to employ some more progressive enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With clients much will depend on budget, the client&#39;s relative interest and anything we know about their expected traffic. Perhaps accessibility is the main consideration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software dependencies and skills. With so much new CSS spec coming out, it seemed like a good time to have a chat about how we handle browser support. In particular baseline, which is a Google initiative introduced in 2023 that aims to make it easier for developers and other website stakeholders to understand what might be ready for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, after all these years, I don’t think we’ve ever really had a chat on browser support, have we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s because, two reasons I think. One is it’s very boring and secondly I think probably ’cause we’re a bit slack when it comes to this thing. we’ve been, actually we’ve put this on the show notes, so you might as well bring those up now, but let’s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, talking about kind of the past when it comes to this stuff now, it’s come to the forefront. I think now for us, or at least for me, because I’m back into the hand coding and there’s a whole heap of new stuff, that is coming out from the W three C and it’s hard to keep up with what browsers will support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can go into production. But, previously, for us in a way we may be, I dunno about you, Nathan, but I mean you started obviously with the hand code back in the days where we had IE six or probably even, going from IE five to IE six. Oh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh, yeah. Really that far back. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; more recently, we’ve just handed over, we did hand that responsibility over increasingly to platforms that we would, as WordPress users for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we’d say, okay, the theme will take care of that kind of stuff for us, or the page builder later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think you’re right. I think if you are a core participant of this podcast, if you are really listening to this because you want to learn about modern CSS and HT ML, this stuff will matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s also quite likely that a lot of the people listening to this will never really have ENC encountered this problem. the expectation is that all the browsers are the same. It doesn’t matter whether you are using Firefox or Chrome. They all do. Broadly the same thing, and it’s got lost that in the midst of time, the browsers really, went in their own direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And then by the time that the, page builders were rising in ascendancy, certainly in the WordPress scene, a lot of that interoperability had been solved. The browser manufacturers began to talk to themselves, and so both you and I. Just handed over the responsibility of what can a browser do to our page builder tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the assumption being that if it’s built into the page builder, the builders of the page builder will have done the work of checking whether or not the things that they ship are possible. can this actually be displayed? And, yeah. and I’m still very much there. It has been a very long time since I’ve looked at this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, this is. Actually, you said it was quite a boring subject for me. It’s really interesting because I genuinely haven’t looked at this for ages, and yet if you think about it, there’s an awful lot of new stuff coming around and if we don’t know what’s possible, then there’s a, I honestly, I think there’s a significant chance that you’ll ship something which simply won’t work for a proportion of the users out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s, it is been a transition, obviously, when I first did it in the early days, hand coding, then you were always waiting. There’s a wonderful, and I’ve put a link actually on the bottom there to the introduction video by Rachel. Andrew for Google, ’cause she’s a Google employee and she actually talks about the kind of old days where you really always were waiting for a browser to finally die, so you could implement some of the new cool stuff that the later browser supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s, it is definitely worth watching that one. But, yeah, my own experience of that really was that I handed over this control slowly. in, WordPress I used to. Have a basically a, theme framework and then built my own CSS, so I had to consider it. Then when I moved to a page builder, it used Bootstrap, which had already done the thought about what it can support as a ma massive popular thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no longer did I have to consider it. So it’s come back to the forefront, not only because I’ve got the responsibility now, but also because so much has changed in the way, that we’ve now got ever. Green browsers that are pumping out monthly new features, and we’ve got so many new features coming out for CSS from the pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I ask you a couple of things around that? Firstly, if you are using tooling, so let’s say for example that you’re using a SaaS product like Wix or Squarespace, or if you’re using a page builder inside a CMS like WordPress, do you think you need to be bothered about this subject or do you think it is a fair assumption still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to hand that off to the developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think, I mean, if we’re doing it professionally, I think it was interesting to me, I won’t mention their name, but one page builder that kind of us up, the one that I was using, had I. Much, lower level of support for older browsers than the one that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for majority of people, perhaps they’re using it for their own personal projects and it’s not so much a worry, but I did notice that some developers there were caught short because it was ruin in the layouts for certain professional clients that they might need to have. So I think it’s still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps important to know. Yeah. this is the big problem, isn’t it? how many old browsers do we need to support, that? and I don’t think this conversation’s ever gonna solve that, but baseline does at least help us know what the majority of the main core browsers will accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But yeah. but yeah, sorry. the other question that I had was, could you explain what an Evergreen browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; is? Because Yeah, we’re going straight up. We put in our notes here, all of these points in order, but we’re just skipping around, but, oh, sorry about, yeah. So yeah, so really, and this also ties in with something which is’ in the notes, which is this whole thing we talked about before, this idea that the key players, the core browsers, the people behind Chrome or chromium browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge, Microsoft Safari and Mozilla with Firefox all kind of got together to agree within their roles in the W three C working groups that they would implement within a year with this interoperability where they would all agree, we’re going to achieve this and we’re going to put this feature into our browsers, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s come along and I’ve forgotten what your question was. No, it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just an explanation of what an evergreen browser is because I expect that, oh yeah. Most people don’t really even need to know ’cause of the nature of how browsers work in the operating system these days. But when, yes, when we were, beginning our journey, there was no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s just, a contrast of what that’s meant over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that’s it. they do update regularly now. they had a bit of an issue with Safaria because it was tied to the operating system that they couldn’t automatically update. But yes, it used to be a case where well updates as, Rachel Andrew mentions, There was like a two year gap or something between, yeah, I think it was IE six and seven, or was it five and six? Anyway, and that could be what you’re, you are waiting on that one to be able to change and people really, you were waiting on people’s computers to die, wouldn’t you, to Yeah. to get the next browser, because people wouldn’t do it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wouldn’t go out and update themselves unless it was. Automated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; and the updating process was a manual process, and like you said, it was a big deal. So I remember when, Firefox three came out. So back in the day when, you know, going from three to four to five to six, that was a big moment. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Google Chrome came along and I, I. I think it was the first one that kind of enforced auto updating. If you use that browser, it was just going to do it in the background so that when you restarted your computer or you switched chrome off and then restarted it, it would update and there was no hint of you need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. And that was a big moment because suddenly it meant that the browser was always up to date. If you switched your computer on and off or you, closed the browser down. And and I use a variant of Chrome. I use Brave a lot. I. And they have this process of alerting you, I suspect it’s the same in Google’s Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the top right hand corner, you get this little button, which this little green button, which says update, and you press that and you wait 10 seconds and the browser restarts. And really it’s services normal almost immediately. But that update button comes very frequently. every few weeks I’m hitting that update button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s a it, there is a real change over time and that’s meant. A lot of important things that can happen on the internet can now happen more or less instantaneously if the browsers support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, it’s interesting really because I’ve not seen many people talk about it because when you think about it, it doesn’t have give the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;browser vendors, a whole lot of control that they can just update what you are going to have. And, some of that might be about taking your data as well, with some of them. And, yeah, that’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; a good point. I can’t remember the last time I updated my browser and it offered me an option to decline something or accept something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just happens and it. Honestly, it really is, as you’ll know, it’s 10 seconds you wait, and then it’s back to exactly where you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s good for us. there’s people trying to build web pages. it’s, it’s almost impossible to advance the web and make it look good if, people are gonna stay on that old browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from our point of view, it’s a really, it’s a good thing. But, there is that other side where you think, okay. Allowing that much control to update. Yeah, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; sorry about that. I hijacked the conversation by asking what an Evergreen browser was, and we totally skipped out this bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do you wanna describe baseline? I’m guessing David, right? I’m putting my finger in the air here. I’m gonna bet that a significant proportion of people who listen to this won’t know that this exists. I know that for you it’s terribly important, but I’m guessing that baseline will be a new and interesting thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve just seen it around and it’s only been around, I think it was May, 2023 that they introduced it. We’ll know from that video someone looks at that, but, and so it, it is pretty new. And the key thing is that they’ve been, I. rolling this out over time. So initially I think it was just on, web dev because it’s, it’s a Google thing, but it’s gone and it’s shown now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when there’s a feature, a new CSS feature mentioned on the MDN or on Can I use, which is what I think most people I know as. Go to as the website to see what browser support is for feature. It’s also baseline just now been added to all of these places. And it is, and we didn’t set this up really. We should have done so we, we can see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I can just give you the URLO. it’s a fairly easy thing to find. The, the URL is just, if you go to web. Dev slash baseline. or you can just go to our show notes, which is, no script show slash nine ’cause this is episode nine and you can find a link to it there, but it just explains what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could put it on the screen, but it just says who’s involved and what it is. But do you wanna just paraphrase that who’s involved and what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I did. I just wanna clear something up on that though. It’s just what I meant is where it’s showing because on all of those documentation, so if you go to, can I use, now you’ve got a little bar on the top that says baseline and the a nice tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you go to the got it MDN records, so it’s gone to these three platforms. So when you arrive to learn about a new feature that you could use. In your websites, suddenly you’ve got this big best line saying, it’s saying two things. So our film, this baseline comes out and it has two stages, which is newly available, which means that it’s supported by those core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in theory, we should be able to put it into that, gives you a tick and we should be able to support it. And then we’ve got the other stage, which is widely available, which is. when 30 months have passed, that’s, as I was reading it, the feature now can be used on most sides without worrying about support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and usually when it gets to widely available, instead of just featuring the core browsers who have agreed under, The interoperability to implement things. What I’ve noticed, if you go to say the MDN records and look for more details, if you take something like Grid, which has been around for some time, you’ll see that it starts to list other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where it’s implemented in other browsers, say Samsung and, things. So it’s quite interesting. So it does add onto it, but yeah, so baseline in theory is something where we can say, okay, it’s newly available. There might be some bugs with it somewhere else, but I should be able to use this in production ’cause it’s supported by most of the browsers and if it’s widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we should be able to say, look at a client. this is what this says. This is measuring this. We should be able to use this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I was just gonna paraphrase everything that you just said, if that’s all right. the baseline is, essentially it’s a place where you can go and you can judge whether some new feature of, I’m gonna put air quotes around this, the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s say, I don’t know, something in CSS or something like that, is. Is widely supported or newly available? actually the language is newly available or widely available. Yes. If it’s newly available, then it’s probably going to be usable. But if you, if it then moves to widely available, then that means that, what did you say, 13 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s right. 30 months has passed and you can more or less go to the bank on the fact that’s gonna be supported in the browsers in question. And they are as follows as of this moment. safari on Mac Os and iOS. Interesting. Firefox on desktop and Android also. Interesting ’cause I don’t know if they have an iOS version, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome on desktop. And Android. Again, no mention of iOS there and Edge. But only on desktop. And I do know that they have an Android version and it’s, it’s had millions of downloads. So that’s the rules around which baseline is working. It’s not like a philanthropic endeavor to just make it easy to understand what you can start using with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think when you get to widely available, usually the, if you go to can I use where we usually get a sort of percentage, you usually find that’s in the high nineties. Yeah. And really you don’t find anything. I don’t, I think there’s almost next to nothing that’s a feature of CSS that’s fully supported to a hundred percent There’s always some something out of that. There is some, I think this is a great incentive and there’s a good reason behind having this baseline because clearly with evergreen browsers and monthly updates or multiple, updates coming in a month, adding new features in some of them, which won’t be in that project with interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Chrome has run ahead with some things, which they, all can, they’re all guaranteed to implement. Certain things they agree on within a year, but after that, it’s up to them. When they do that within that year and what they want to focus on outta the spec, they might jump on something which is in the spec as far as the W three C is concerned, but it’s not part of what they’ve agreed to implement altogether as the core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think when you get to a widely available that it’s probably caught on by other browsers and end up being in the 90%. But there is a. there’s an article which was slightly critical back, last year. it’s from, and I put the link in the show notes there. It’s there. If you scroll down there, it’s an article by someone called Molly Lee, where she was, and it looks like things have been changed a little bit on there, but she was just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing out that, the at layer role, which is fairly new, was showing widely available as baseline as it’s showing in various places. But when she looked at it using, can I use it was still only supporting the. Supported by about 90% of browsers at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so what we need is a new service which combines baseline with, can I use for abstraction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, we can have a graph of does it work in baseline? Does it work in, can I use, yeah. Another layer of abstraction? No. you are basically saying there are people challenging whether or not baseline is actually keeping perfectly up to date right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think it’s, for one thing it was slightly changed when I saw it, so it seems to have been downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure if the article has checked everything correctly or I’ve read it correctly, but it was just interesting that you can, in terms of can I use, get a percentage now most people I know. Have you got the tab there, Nathan? With I on? I have, yeah. Let me, let me, it might be worth talking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put that one on. Okay. Because before baseline, this is pretty much where, and it still is. If I watch a YouTube video, somebody will probably talk about browser support and go straight here as the place to get the statistics. And we were having a play around earlier as well, What, I don’t see many people mention, but there are some in the, under the settings, a way of being able to pull in, import the data for different areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you did that Nathan earlier? Yeah. Give&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; me audio listener. But, we’re on the, can I use.com website and the button where you can click to, alter the settings and you can add in. the thing that we did is we added in the UK as. And the United States is, data to show. But also we did play around with, the view mode a little bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, the settings are just buried here, right at the top in the, in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; header. Yeah. And we was just in enjoying as two Brits, the facts that, Yeah. Often when we’re looking at support for many of the things that we looked at was slightly higher in the UK than it was in the us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. It’s an interesting way of pausing it though, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, we’re all using the exact same browsers. It’s just the, the cocktail of who’s using what in which country, which leads to those numbers to go up. But we’re looking, you can see at the top here, we put in grid. So we’re able to see for example, that grid support is, the further down this chart that you go, the more recent the version of that browser is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s Chrome’s latest update and edge and so on. So you can see that basically Chrome. and all the other major browsers have a green light on grid, so that is one thing that we can use. Yeah. But if we were to change grid over to something, a bit more air quotes, again, cutting edge, we might find that it’s a bit more patchy as a few more red spots here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and it’s, quite interesting. And what also, what we can see on this, for those who are watching on YouTube, is that the baseline is actually written there. So just above the title, let’s say in CSS grid layout level one, then we have, and that, that’s what baseline’s being used, it’s being represented there in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use, so you get a quick. Overview of that’s a widely supported in all major&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; route. So it’s when we’re looking at, can I use, and we’re, like I said, we’re looking at grid. Is it the fact that this looks like a tick? Is it this tick? Is that icon representative of a tick, because it also feels like it’s a logo, like the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s a tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’re not set up to do this, but it would be interesting to look at the MDN records and that, so you get a slightly more information in the little tick bar on that one. But, so it looks slightly different, but it’s been added in only quite recently that it didn’t come out with this. It too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can I use. That’s a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; very,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quick way of determining, so if that’s a tick, then we can be confident that baseline at least, is saying that there is what did we call it? It’s widely available in Chrome Edge, safari and Firefox. That’s just, you can take that in one quick hit of the eye. yeah, if you’ve got the little tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s actually really useful, isn’t it? You’d have to delve around in here. You can just see straight away if it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Alright. Thank you. One of the interesting things, we said we were gonna look into this and I did for this one, I think it was the article by Molly Lee, that actually made me aware, ’cause I often wondered this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this statistic, where did they get the data for? Can I use Yeah. Where. it’s, it is stat counter, which I’ve often looked at as well for browser support. yeah, but where do they get it from? that’s the thing now what they say, and there’s a lot of frequently asked questions, which does a good job at answering those kind of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the. I’ve got them in our show notes. The summary is that the data’s coming from, 1.5 million plus sites, which is amounting to 5 billion page views per month. And that’s what is counting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; those. It sounds like a lot, but then if you imagine, the internet as a whole, that’s probably chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in terms of the actual amount of sites being browsed and the sites available online, it’s still jaw dropping amounts of data, but I do wonder quite how, quite how accurate that is. And it’d be interesting to drill down into that one time to see which 1.5 million sites. ’cause I suppose that would matter, if it was 1000, 1 million, one point, easy for you to say, Nathan, 1.5 million very reputable sites, well great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it’s 1.5 million, very edge case, weirdy old designs from. Geo, perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. And can you imagine if it was a, say we, we looked like we were doing slightly better in the UK for support on some of the newer features, but what if that’s just the fact that there. Partners that they have in the UK are mostly putting them on tech sites where it’s likely to have people who will have modern browsers more than say something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we were talking earlier, and I was mentioning to you this kind of a, with having a bunch of clients who do counseling and psychotherapy. Wow. And looking at some of their stats wowing. Yeah. That there was such an obvious skew towards Apple product products and particularly the Safari browser. Compared to other sites that I was used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it’s something to do with that kind of middle class audience who go for, private psychotherapy who might go for that kind of products. And it’s, so I have to, so regardless of baseline. You still end up coming back to what you might know about. Yeah, I think that’s really inter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so the demographic of that particular audience, but you can imagine that there’s a whole bunch of audiences where the de demographic skews upwards socioeconomically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re probably gonna have a different relationship with their technology. typically an iPhone is more expensive than an Android phone. And you, and actually you do find that in North America, iOS iPhones dominate the, smartphone market. Whereas if you look at other places like South America, and Africa, it’s typically Android that’s winning that battle by a massive margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you look at Europe, it’s, it’s. Smorgasbord of countries. It’s a bit of a mixture. some countries it appears that iOS and the default, I think, for many on iOS is just to use safari. And then, other countries will be Android. And so it goes. And so it’s really interesting, A, what devices are they using?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B, what’s the sort of socioeconomic impact of the niche that they’re in? And it will all skew, won’t it? So in the case that you are describing. if it’s like psychotherapy or whatever it is. The assumption there, I think that you were making was that it’s probably those people who are browsing those websites have probably got a little bit of disposable income and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a high likelihood that they’ll have a modern up-to-date device and so on and so forth. It’s really interesting, the psychology of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is as well. effectively it hasn’t made much difference. A baseline would’ve been enough probably to cover me, right? Most of ’em seem to have a more modern browser, and with interoperability, it’s not been such an issue, but sometimes that might, it did concern me a little bit because there is that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think typically we’re looking for the last two versions of the core browsers. If they’re, if they’ve been supporting it, then we pretty much feel it’s safe to go ahead with it for main production for most of us. but it did make me concerned where there might be a lot of safari knowing that some of the older iPhones cannot update, their browser, not evergreen because it’s baked into the way that the operating system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wonder to myself whether that might have an impact, whether, but obviously. I have not seen any issue. Obviously these people who can afford psychotherapy can also afford the latest iPhone. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It really is interesting. Yeah, yeah. Okay. where should we move next? Then we’ve got this other topic here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or sorry, did you finish everything about Yeah, I, we baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; cautiously. Yeah. Yeah, you did mention something again, and I don’t know if it’s in our notes. It’s not because it’s a kind of a side that we had and that was, there’s a gap in my knowledge. You were talking about the fact that there was so many other browsers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; most of them we guess are chromium, so we imagine not knowing much about browsers. This is more investigation to do, Yeah. that they would just automatically get the kind of new CSS features that come with chromium. so no issue. Yeah. That is my assumption,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But, and this is what I discovered the other day, but it always interested me that they mentioned as one of the core browsers edge, which is chromium. Yep. So you wonder, why do you need to look at that and measure that one? And I, came up with it only yesterday and I’ll be doing a video on it, on, there’s a new CSS, light and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you can actually have your light and dark preferences side by side. And I was looking at support, it’s not supportive very well at the moment, but supported in chromium but not in edge. And I thought, okay, so I don’t know anything any longer because yeah, that’s, that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting because some, you would imagine that core feature would ship out of the chromium project, not only to Google’s Chrome, but to Microsoft’s edge and to any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivative of Chrome. Yeah. But there are lots of derivatives of Chrome. just to mention a few. Now actually, I don’t know that these are derivatives of Chrome, but I’m sure that some of them are. But so for example, do Go, has a browser, there’s a browser called Brave. There’s a browser called Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a browser called Safari. sorry, not Safari, Vivaldi. It ends in an eye. and they are, as far as I’m aware, they’re all chromium derivatives, but they all have a little twist on the ui. one touts itself as more developer, with developer tools baked into it, one touts itself as a bit more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s stripping out. I dunno. third party cookies or ad networks or things like that. And then there are other ones that I’ve heard of, for example, one called Sidekick. There’s a bunch that you can get on the mobile devices as well. And I don’t know whether they’re adding new things in differently. I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or taking away things differently. My assumption was that it was always like UI components or things around the edge of the browser, not the edge of the, I do. so things like the security model and the third party cookie model, but not the presentation layer, not what would be shown on the screen, which is of what, which is what is of interest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. But if Edge is doing something different with the light dark, Then something’s going on and let’s hope we don’t go back to the good old days of having to inspect every browser for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh boy. there, there is notes on that as well. Funny enough, I did actually test it and it, even though it’s saying on baseline that it’s not supported, in fact it actually was actually, it worked okay in my version, but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it, my only rationale behind it and I would love somebody to tell me what’s actually happening. I never bother to read the bug note. So is it something that, it does work natively? There’s something that Edge has done with implemented something else which has broken that particular feature. So that’s maybe why it’s listed as not working when Chrome does work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think baseline has come in and helped in many ways ’cause it gives us something we can talk about where we couldn’t before because we could talk to a client Yes. About okay, we just gotta wait for IE five to die. And and we’re almost there. dear client, we can, looks like. We’re building this, it’s gonna be a few months, we can go ahead with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can’t say the same with monthly updates. We can’t know what version we’re on with any of the browsers. We dunno what’s going on. So baseline at least solves that kind of problem first. At least we can say, look, this is some measure of what is probably production ready based on the, the, core browsers that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Now influential they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But we still don’t get away from. What do we do about that? And there’s two approaches in a way to dealing with it anyway, if, no. Some of these are mentioned in, W three C called graceful degradation and Progressive Enhancement. Easy for you to say. I wish it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. But they, these are kind of terms that are banded around and they’re Two sides of the same coin, really. So grace, graceful degradation is the approach where you might go at building for the modern browsers whilst considering that there’s a less experience for, older browsers, but not so much caring about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then progressive enhancement is perhaps the more favored way of the people who are much cleverer than me. Of going about things where they start with the base level in the way that they built their websites, and then everything else is seen as a, an enhancement. If this browser supports it, then you know this is going to make the, experience better for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually did it on this site, on our. Episodes, and I think it’s also some, one of the other pages there was a, I put Subgrid in, which has really got enough support. Okay? And this is something that you can at least add in a certain way. It was just to put a little line between texts and separate a sort of subgrid so things were even, so if your browser didn’t support it well, things would just be a bit uneven, but the content would still be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive enhancements a little bit like that where you might run ahead with some of the things that might not be fully supported, knowing that they’re not going to break something. Could I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; posit a third option as well, which isn’t, hasn’t got an official title, but it’s non-progressive on enhancement, which basically means you only do the things which you know will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ll only implement, and I would imagine for most people, that’s gonna be the default, right? You’re not gonna spend time on a client website where money’s tight, deadlines are tight, building in a bunch of features that a tiny subset will use, but that will, swing up over time. Wouldn’t the enterprise for most people simply be to say, okay, I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just build the things that I know are gonna work. So it’s neither graceful degradation nor progressive enhancement. It’s just whatever I want to call it. It’s just build what we know works. Look at baseline, do that, come back in a year’s time, have another run at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I would argue that’s probably where the progressive enhancement people start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make sure that it works for everybody and then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. So then it’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; progressive non enhancement, if you just leave it there. You don’t enhance anything. You just do the bare minimum, if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. The pro, the progressive enhancements people might not enhance much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Exactly. but yeah, but there are, there always have been because you can see how annoying it is, To go back to the past, I think it was from IE five to IE six, you would wait just to have flipping rounded corners on stuff instead of having to cut out little images and put them round things so they look like you’ve got rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re really showing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; our age, aren’t we? And there were things like transparent PNGs. oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Yeah. So all of that stuff, but we still got similar kind of thing happening for us now. and I think view transitions, which is only in chromium at the moment, which will come to all, but it’s not as far as I understand agreed as part of the interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you might wanna just run ahead for that because it’s so wonderfully cool. And if. Only it’s gonna happen for the people who’ve got Chrome and it seems to be about 60% people. Okay. The rest of ’em will just not get a lovely transition to their page. They’ll just get a regular transition. So that’s progressive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think at its best where it fails is, where you’ve got a feature, and that’s in the article that was looking at layers that were saying that it had less support but was. Put down as widely available. That’s a breaking feature. So effectively with layers, you’ll put in a bunch of CSS in an area, separate to where your main CSS is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those browsers who can’t read it. Suddenly won’t have that styling that you’ve put in there. So you really need to be quite smart about using that as a progressive enhancement. Yeah, it’s more of a breakable, thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It, interesting what came out of that little paragraph that you said there, the last minute or so is, I guess the progressive enhancement is all about the things which are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, for want of a better word, the things which really are transformational, you might put the time in because, having rounded corners, as we said, or a transparent image as we said, that was groundbreaking, significantly better. It, the whole experience, just everything looked better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same would be true here. You’re not gonna do those really weirdy edge cases, things that don’t really do a lot for your project, but the ones where. It’s transformational. It will take for those users who can enjoy that progressive enhancement, it will take it from a, a mere experience to, oh gosh, that’s significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s where you, maybe that’s where you put your time. You just judge what is significant, what will have the most impact, and work on those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think the graceful degradation approach is the sort of, you you’re just gonna give for the best because you’re not, it’s about the time, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new CSS functions, rounding corners, you know how painful that was to try and cut out images. Yeah. And then position them around something to create that, when you could just do it with a line of CSS with border radius, you know, so that, you might just say, okay. I’m gonna go for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna go for the latest and graceful degradation will be that they won’t get any rounded corners, It doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. But I want people to have the best stuff that’s out there. So cost comes into this. I think this is such a big topic, isn’t it? Yeah. But there are two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did put in the notes there two things that I suppose. go with the approaches, at least my interpretation. And that is that for those who might prefer a more graceful degradation approach, there’s polyfills, which is Yeah. JavaScript really, which will just, mock up the missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;features that are in older browsers, so you can get away with that, can’t you? So something’s coming in, it’s coming to W three C. You want that stuff now. You don’t want to do the alternative way of doing it. You stick it in and you find a polyfil and you use that. It doesn’t mean that you rely on JavaScript, which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progressive enhancement, people go, yeah, you need JavaScript for this CSS thing. So yeah, so it might not suit those. And then the other thing for progressive enhancement, but really long-winded is to use the at support, right? feature query as it’s called. So it’s a kinda like a media query if you like, which will say, within that you’ll say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At supports, and then you put in the things, and if the browser supports them, it’ll implement them, and if it doesn’t, it’ll ignore them. So that’s a way of being able to progressively enhance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; and just that is actually really nice, isn’t it? The fact that is even a feature. You don’t have to go through some strange way of detecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s lovely. you’ve got this option of putting things in this conditional logic basically of, is this supported? Yes. Great. Go for it. If not, then don’t. That’s nice. That’s neat. so what, so where does this is the, is the question By os do you mean os me and you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after summarizing this, I don’t, I do like baseline. I think what it is for this project, which we’re doing at the moment, our website, which is part of the show, I think it’s safe, for us to say anything that comes under baseline is good enough for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Widely available. Baseline. You going for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, newly. Newly I think as well. Alright. there might be some bugs with it. I think it’s probably, I. that’s my kind of take on it. and I think we will, as I’ve already done one with the subgrid, use some progressive enhancements. Maybe we’ll use this few transitions before it’s in the other, ’cause it’s an experimental website for people who we expect will probably jump onto modern browsers pretty early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s right. But for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; clients maybe it’s a different, with this website you can go. You can go wherever you like, can’t you? Because it’s your project. It’s like a pet project. It’s not, yeah. the basis of anybody’s business relying on this or anything. So you can do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually the fact that the subject matter of the website is exactly this gives you license to do anything you like, really go as crazy as uncut, bleeding edge as you wish, but with clients. You, are you gonna be much more, cautious, not implementing things that might work and might not, is it more widely available from baseline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean from, as we mentioned, not having to worry about it, it’s been baked into the. Builder that we’ve had, I’ve suddenly had to think about it. So last few clients I have mentioned it, it’s been one of these things that I’ve said to them, by the way, I’m gonna be building this basically with baseline in mind, almost before it came out actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but that kind of level of two b browser support on the core ones, the last two versions was enough. And I’ve been saying that to clients unless there’s other reason that’s what I’m going to do. So it won’t support some of these older browsers because I’m feeling that so much new CSS. It’s come out and that evergreen browsers, people will catch up, that it won’t be a good investment for me to hold back and do things a more complicated way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so yes, I’ve been largely saying that, but of course it’s always gonna depend, doesn’t it? As I say, if you know something about the client’s existing traffic, if it’s a rebuild, then you’ve got some insight as to what they might need to support, which might not be in keeping with what. I would ideally want to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I guess time will tell, but it’s, there. It’s there for you to check out. Now you can go and look at baseline. I guess it’s gonna be important if you’re an agency owner or something, you’re gonna have to have a posture on this. You’re gonna have to be explaining to your clients, like David just said, how many versions back in browser, history do you want to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you’ll be having those conversations. But do you think we’ve done that one? Is the baseline episode done? Okay. That sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think that. Yeah, it’s, I just think it’s a very nice thing to be able to say to clients to say, we work to this method, rather than have to make it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say. Here we run to baseline I, yeah. Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; neat. Yeah. That’s a neat way of just pausing it, isn’t it? And then you can just give them the documentation. They can go and see. Oh, okay. That kind of offsets the responsibility. You’d have to name the browsers one at a time. It’s just to work with baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. It’s like a credential, isn’t it? There’s what you set, and then anything else is over the top, which might be needed by the client, so that, yeah. Yeah. That’s the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That was us. That was the no script show. Number nine. If you want to, find all of the bits and pieces that we’ve been showing on the screen, go to the url, no script show slash nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to, find the episode there forward slash subscribe. If you wanna subscribe. And if you wanna find us on YouTube, you probably have, already, but it’s youtube.com/at the at symbol. No script show and and subscribe. Smash that bell, whatever it is that successful YouTubers ask you to do, that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a bunch of those things. I don’t know what they are, but, Okay. Are we done David? We are. Thanks. That was a good chat. Yeah. Perfect. Have a nice day. See you later. Yeah, you do. Bye-Bye bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adding a light and dark mode with a toggle</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/9/" />
    <updated>2024-04-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/9/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is following on from podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/8&quot;&gt;episode 8&lt;/a&gt; where Nathan and I finally started talking about designing the show&#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that episode I offered a rough homepage mock up and together we attempted to critically access it in the way various experts might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am looking at the light and dark mode toggle in that design. I&#39;ll share the code I&#39;m initially going to use and also talk about my concerns over present implementations of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering a dark mode toggle is trending right now, but we are including it because It is not entirely inconceivable that one day this might be considered a standard for most websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this because browser and (particularly mobile) device vendors have good reasons to want to offer a portable web experience that can respond to the environmental light, available battery life and what the user personally finds comfortable. These vendors have a powerful influence on the W3C working groups which recently has been giving us many new ways to work with a variety of user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can cover this better with Nathan when we do our planned podcast episode on the user preferences we can, or soon will be able to, honour using CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;embracing-the-dark-side&quot;&gt;Embracing the dark side?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark mode that&#39;s presently on the initial site was a whim. We wanted to start with only enough design to make our early content presentable and the dark aspect gave its stark appearance a little more interest with most sites being light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honouring a user&#39;s (system or browser) preference for dark or light is not technically difficult (at least with simple designs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, we can add to our CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; light dark&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if we create a HTML page the browsers own user agent styles will kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our device or browser is set to dark mode the browser will give us light text against a dark background and visa versus is set to light. It will also apply dark and light styling to the browser built in components as I previously used with the audio element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most will not want this as the styles colours added by browser are similar but not the same. I personally prefer Firefox&#39;s slightly lighter and blue tinged background to chrome&#39;s default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take control of our own light and dark colours we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/a&gt; media query. Baseline (which we talk about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://noscript.show/9&quot;&gt;episode 9&lt;/a&gt; of the podcast) classifies it as &amp;quot;widely available&amp;quot; across browsers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/?search=prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;Can I use&lt;/a&gt; in April 2024 says it is96% supported globally (higher in the UK and USA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon things may get easier when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark&quot;&gt;light-dark()&lt;/a&gt; function gets better browser support. With this you will be able write your CSS like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;body {color: light-dark(color-1, color-2);
background-color: light-dark (color-1, custom color-2);
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or assign them to custom properties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; light dark&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 100%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;240&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 10%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 10%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--shade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 100%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;240&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 10%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 10%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dark-mode-toggle-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dark mode toggle dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although initially some felt it was enough to let the user decide their preference via their browser or device settings I think most have come to realise that most users don&#39;t know there is this option and if they do they may not alway want it . The way to solve both issues is to offer a toggle switch on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he good news is that thanks to the newly supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has&quot;&gt;:has()&lt;/a&gt; CSS relational pseudo-class we can create a toggle without needing JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/oNOwqMW&quot;&gt;great demo of this&lt;/a&gt; by Bramus Van Damme. He works for Google and is definitely someone to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His light dark switch works by using :has() to see if an HTML input has been checked. If so, it uses that associated CSS rule if not it uses the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snag with using this as a light and dark toggle is that it only applies to the page you are on. I set up a demo and concluded the experience is worse that not having a toogle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hello-js-my-old-friend&quot;&gt;Hello JS my old friend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want the user&#39;s toggled preference to remain until they say otherwise we need javaScript to hold this request in the user&#39;s local storage in their browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I&#39;m doing presently. The javaScript I used was prompted with Chat GPT, but seems to have been working fine on another site I did last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-light-in-the-darkness&quot;&gt;Some light in the darkness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sure how to conclude this. I did not like the idea of relying on javaScript. I did not like that I could not use the prefers-color-scheme to swap my logo if I had a toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I felt that if the overall aim of the W3C is to encourage a more user preference based web I am not sure that leaving web designers to come up with their own UI for this is the right way. More confusion for users and developers individually reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered Bramus had a few days ago released a proof of concept [light and dark mode extension for chrome](https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/ target=). I missed it, but he has been arguing that there should be settings in the browser based on the web site viewed for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly If all browsers did adopt it would address some of my uneasiness with it and make it easy for those wanting to only use HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt it would create other concerns like should it only show if the site has a light and dark mode to stop users pointless clicking for something that does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think this probably tells us is that the state of a user preference based web is very much in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
