    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-css&quot;&gt;New CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit&quot;&gt;Object fit&lt;/a&gt; which resized images to fit its container. The cover value is particularly useful as you can responsively crop the image to the available space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;Aspect ratio.&lt;/a&gt; There is no need to hack this with calc anymore. On our site we needed the YouTube thumbnail images (and iframe)to remain at 16:9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image&quot;&gt;Border image.&lt;/a&gt;It can do more than images to borders. A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article shows what can be done to enhance or replace images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter&quot;&gt;Filter:&lt;/a&gt;Blur, brightness, contrast, drop-shadow, hue rotate, invert, grayscale, saturate, sepia and opacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path&quot;&gt;Clip-path&lt;/a&gt; to clip out images to shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image&quot;&gt;Mask-image&lt;/a&gt; Images masking images. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_masking.asp&quot;&gt;Example.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter&quot;&gt;Backdrop-filter.&lt;/a&gt; Limited support. Mostly useful for blurring an image where you place text over it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt; There is the still experimental prefers-reduced-data media query to get rid of non essential images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is that images are inline elements. We have to tame them with a CSS reset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;img, picture, svg, video&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; block&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;max-inline-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 100%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; auto&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-css-revisited&quot;&gt;Old CSS revisited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML Img tag v CSS background img. Meaningful content vs decorative. Which is a logo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alt tags. For screen readers rather than SEO boasting. Using blank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-html&quot;&gt;New HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading=&amp;quot;lazy/eager&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Hints: fetchpriority=&amp;quot;high/low&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-html-revisited&quot;&gt;Old HTML revisited&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;picture&gt; is easily forgotten. It allows for &amp;quot;art direction&amp;quot; - showing a range of image sources depending on the media query (such as viewport size or light/dark preference).&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;srcset serves a range of images based on viewport size and/or pixel density. We need something better as CMS&#39;s can never automate these efficently and manual writing and image cropping is overwhelmingly time consuming and messy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/&quot;&gt;This tool helps&lt;/a&gt;. Responsive images fail us with container queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;. The element that marks up a photo in a document has &lt;figcaption&gt; to define a caption for the photo.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a question. If we build for not visual consumption should every image that is not marked as a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; be background image?&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things like this in HTML. See this &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/a-call-for-consensus-on-html-semantics/&quot;&gt;post by Stephanie Eckles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-formats&quot;&gt;New formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webp (widely available 98%) and AVIF (newly available 93%) mostly solves the old problem of which is suitable for the type of image (jpg, gif or png).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVGs goes back to 1999. V2 from 2018. There are future proof, good for usabilty and SEO (if labelled corretly) and we can do some amazing thing with SVG filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-a-bitmap-picture-worth-a-thousand-words&quot;&gt;Is a bitmap picture worth a thousand words?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser processes time and the environmental cost is high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to serve 320px (if we ignore watches) to 7680 px screens efficiently is not easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we overloaded with stock and AI images that trust has been eroded to the point we try to block them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS&#39;s in their attempt to help quickly fill up our server space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, it can be a struggle to get a decent picture of a clients even when it could be the only picture a visitor cares about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>User Preferences:- rethinking web design</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/10/" />

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-css-media-features&quot;&gt;New CSS media features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently there&#39;s W3C specifications for 6 CSS media features that allow our design to respond to a user&#39;s browser or device preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included below is the global browser support as of April 2024 from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;Can I use&lt;/a&gt; site and the year when the feature was supported in the core browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;Prefers-color-scheme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors&quot;&gt;Forced-colors*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2020 - 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast&quot;&gt;Prefers-contrast:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; supported in 2022 - 97%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; experimental - 68%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; experimental - 0%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* An example of a forced colour mode is Windows High Contrast mode where you might want to provide an alternative to subtleties like box shadows to mark out an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;statistics-on-user-preferences&quot;&gt;Statistics on user preferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on user behaviour is not easy to find, but we can look at Chrome&#39;s data on the percentage of features included on the pages they crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3581&quot;&gt;PreferredColorSchemeDarkSetting&lt;/a&gt;- 32%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3870&quot;&gt;Forced-colors&lt;/a&gt; 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3869&quot;&gt;Prefers-contrast&lt;/a&gt; 14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4364&quot;&gt;Reduced motion&lt;/a&gt; 0.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4635&quot;&gt;Prefers-reduced-transparency&lt;/a&gt; 0.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefers-reduced-data: no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-extra-info-on-dark-mode&quot;&gt;Some extra info on dark mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://earthweb.com/how-many-people-use-dark-mode/#How_Many_People_Use_Dark_Mode_in_2023&quot;&gt;Earthweb&lt;/a&gt; says 81.9% of smartphone users use dark mode and that 64.6% expect websites to apply dark mode automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://helpfultech.net/dark-mode-usage-statistics-2024.html&quot;&gt;Helpfultech&lt;/a&gt; says after 10 p.m., about 82.7% of users put their phones in dark mode, revealing a particular usage trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean-for-designers&quot;&gt;What does this mean for designers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client resistance to anything not visually on brand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost and relative returns on implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concerns about the tech being in its infancy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responding to a user&#39;s preferences may allow better control on branding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with accessibility the cost of not implementing these (progressive enhancements) at build time could be more costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech moves fast. For example if browsers implemented an easy dark/light toggle how quickly would site want a dark/light mode?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers and device vendors have a powerful influence over the web. Now these are in the W3C&#39;s specifications and growing we may not need proof of the direction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-links&quot;&gt;Other Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZTB4rH7Wh8&quot;&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; on adding a light and mode mode with toggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Google employee&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bram.us/2024/04/13/what-if-you-had-real-control-over-light-mode-dark-mode-on-a-per-site-basis/&quot;&gt;case for browsers to support a light/dark toggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-adding-per-website-dark-mode-safari/&quot;&gt;Safari could be adding a per website dark mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software and skills. Today we’re talking about the new CSS media queries that let us design unique experiences according to the preferences website visitors set in their browser or device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is relatively new and increasingly popular, but it also challenges the way we have traditionally approached web design. So David. Are you feeling challenged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:35] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ve been really challenged actually. a little while back I did a, short video on light and dark mode and it opened up so much about being able to, or actually in our case, not being able to use, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some of the new CSS properties for that. yeah. But we did agree though that you would not call me challenge, but call me special from now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You are special,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; David. Okay. that’s absolutely fine by me. I guess the interesting thing here is that we really are heading into a new era where it’s possible for the person viewing the webpage to have some sort of, some ability to change various things in the past until almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say now what is what you get. dear viewer, I’m gonna serve you up a website and this is what you’re gonna see. But now we’ve got the option to, to interact with that a little bit, which makes life a little bit more interesting, maybe a little bit more challenging. Shall I show our webpage so that we can begin this episode properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. The show notes. I agree. we started this show really, I guess on the premise that, Everything had changed and we were looking at intrinsic design and we were looking at how we had to give up the idea that we would be setting our designs to some fixed width or something. It had to be squishy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this is, on a similar vein, we now have to give up the idea that perhaps we’re choosing the colors that everybody’s gonna get or even the interactions, So I think, we’re having to get a little bit more abstract all the time, or a little bit more removed away from traditional, print design all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I guess SAS apps and things like that have had bits of this for a while, haven’t they? you’ve been able to tweak the way that, so for example, Facebook looks in certain ways and what have you. but it’s coming under the banner of user preferences and the idea being that anybody can decide a whole bunch of different things, and it’s not just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the light and dark mode, although that was covered in the previous episode nine. By the way, if you want to follow the show notes for this, our website is no script show and then you just append the number of the episode after the forward slash So this will be, episode 10, so it’s no script show, slash 10, and you can see that on the screen right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So shall we begin with these new CSS media features then? Yes, we’ve got six of ’em&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; and we’ve listed them here. And the first one we know about because that’s what we’ve just been talking about, which is prefers color scheme, where we can set things to dark or light mode so we can do a separate design for dark and light with this, and perhaps in the future, certainly in the spec for no preference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we could have three alternatives. Plus what we regularly will theme, So we’ve got that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got, can I just pause you there just for one moment? So I can see that we’ve got a link here, which is, we’ll probably click on in a minute, but you’ve got this supported in 2020 and that comes from, can I use, and then what’s this, 96% that’s next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it seems like quite a high. Yeah. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, for those, yeah. So this is, can I use, has given us the percentage rounded up. I haven’t put the dots. Something, as it presently stands where we’re in April, 2024. so that’s, the browsers who. supporting these different features. So yeah, 96% and of course it’s higher with, can I use, if we look just at the UK or us with that, and I’ve put supported since 2020 because that’s when all the core browsers we were talking about, baseline before, and it, would it meet all of those core browsers there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the next one, shall we just, we will list them all out, shall we? One is, yeah. Let’s list them out and then explore. Yeah. Is preferred reduced motion where we can decide whether we are going to include some of the animations that we might put into, whether we just make animations, something that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only those people who are specifically not set a preference for. I think, again, this is pretty similar statistics on this one. So it’s again, at 96% been supported in the core browser since 2020. And we have forced colors, which I oddly I didn’t even know about this one. Nope. And no, and this again, it’s been out for the same length of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has the same can I use and. It appears to be used quite a lot, but it’s, referring to, or at least the MDN records gives us something. An example of it might be Windows High Contrast Mode, where if somebody set that up, then we might need to have some other styling. So for example. And it’s the one that they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it will make all the drop shadows, the subtle drop shadows evaporate. So if we wanted to section out an area, we might need to put a clear border around it for those people who have chosen to have a, false color with a theme,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I. And is this something that’s, ’cause I noticed you’ve got a little asterisk next to that one, which then is highlighted, be below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gave an example of Windows, high contrast Mode. Now I’m not familiar with that because I have a Mac. is that some sort of setting that you set up in Windows to say, I, for the eyesight that I’ve got, I would prefer everything to be really of, a high contrast across the whole os.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not just in the browser, it’s on everything that Windows shows you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what, this is where I’m a bit under prepared with this one. Okay. Because I do know there are some themes that you can put on, ’cause I, played around with those and there’s a really kind of high contrast theme I think in there as I understand it, that you could just pick, there are other ones, so you could just overwrite basic colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it is that, okay, that’s okay. It’s one to explore. It’s okay. Yeah. There’s things, for us to learn as well. Okay. Okay. And there’s also prefers contrast as well, which may be a separate setting on, that one. So, we’ve got the, oh, sorry, I’ve skipped over one here. I’m looking at other notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve got force colors, which is asterisk, which is the one where that could apply when someone set up a theme that would make sense and prefers contrast, which I believe is a setting that you might choose. To go across all boards, without a theme if you like. Okay. So I think that’s the separation between those two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they, sorry, can I just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; drill down into that? So forced colors is, where you, are enforcing a predetermined set of colors that, that, you want to be there and prefers contrast is a bit more ephemeral. It’s a bit, okay. we want high contrast, but we’re not specifying the color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. I think that’s the case. Yeah. We should have been a bit more prepared with this one, but I do know there’s themes in windows where you could force those kind of colors, and I think the height prefers contrast is just a setting that you might just generally want in the same way that you have setting that increases your font size across, The board uhhuh. and then we’ve got re prefers reduced transparency. Oh, I didn’t cover the contrast. That’s at, 97%. Yeah. And again, this is supported a bit later. That’s 2022 prefers reduced transparency. It’s still experimental. But, it’s only not supported in Firefox and Safari as we’re talking about this, so it’s still got a 68%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use? you can, people are still using that. And what that is totally experimental is the last one, which is prefers reduced data. And that’s only available behind a flag, I think in Chrome. Okay. Or edge. Edge and, odd, oddly opera, which isn’t counted as one of the core. So they’ve all got it ready to go behind a flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes, the reduced data is. A way of us being able to say someone slicks that as their preference. Then how we might honor that might be by. Not loading some custom fonts, being able to just use, say, fonts instead. So if they’ve chosen that we, don’t load that or we don’t load some big images or video or something like that, or serve something as an alternative to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; shall we just very quickly dip into each of these links one at a time and just read the top paragraph? ’cause it might even educate us. Yeah, sure. Bits that we missed, okay. So we’re gonna go for the first one, which is prefer. Prefers color scheme, and we’re gonna end up on the M-D-M-M-D-N web docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it says here, the prefers color scheme CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has requested light or dark color theme. So it’s binary, on or off. A user indicates their preference through an operating system setting. EG light and dark mode. I don’t know if you have ever implemented this, but I’ve got dark mode set across the board on every device that I own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly recent development for me, and it’s largely born out of my lack of battery life on a phone. That was the first thing that Dr. Drove it and I realized that I was saving. Battery by having the black screen instead of the light screen, ’cause you’re not like illuminating the pixels. And it made a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I started to explore what it was like on the Mac, and then I started to hear all sorts of things about, the environmental impact because it’s using less battery power. Is there is an impact on that and it’s in, on my Mac. it works. Some things, are obviously not honoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll probably see some things in a moment that don’t honor it, but on the whole, as you can see here, I don’t know if you’ve got yours switched off. This webpage to me looks like this. It’s black over where you are. Have you got this as black or as white? If you don’t have that switched on. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I have no preference set, so I get white and I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if I set it to light as well. So there is one thing in that, that it actually is not a complete spec because it does give us an option to put in some code that we’re going to have to start it for people who set it to dark, to set it specifically to light. but light and no preference tend to go together at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the future, there may be spec four. it’s not supported in the browsers at the moment, but for no preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. alright. Okay, let’s go to the next one then. But that was, gave us a bit of an overview. So this is prefers reduced motion. I think you covered that probably. but it says here, the prefers reduced motion CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has enabled a setting on their device to minimize the amount of non-essential motion setting is used to convey to the browser on the device that the user prefers an interface that removes, reduces or replaces motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based animations, and I know that there are some people that I know who really suffer when they look at animations on websites that it actually causes something akin to, being on a fairground ride or something like that. You either get this real sense of nausea from it. I, do not have this at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could watch any amount of motion on a screen and it wouldn’t interfere with me at all. But I know that this really does make people feel quite unwell, which is. Which is interesting. anything to add to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:27] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, nothing but people can have it temporarily where they, often something with an ear infection can throw out people’s balance and they find it very difficult then to cope with anything that’s moving around on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But that’s a really interesting one that there’s, a medical aspect to that. Yeah. Which is you can very rarely say that about, web design, that they’re gonna have some impact on people’s actual, physical state. Okay. Forced colors. Let’s just run through these quickly. I. Forced colors, is used to detect if the user agent has enabled a forced colors mode where it enforces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we are a user chosen limited color palette on the page. An example of a forced colors mode is windows high contrast mode. Okay, shall I move on to the next one? Okay, just quickly nipping through these prefers contrast, is used to detect whether the user has requested the web content to be presented with a lower or higher contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m a little bit unsure about what the actual difference with forced and prefers is. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I, think, I got it right. Just having a quick Google search here does look like on the contrast themes that you can have. So I think the force colors is because the force schemes will force their own color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. On the, okay. and I think the high contrast is simply just a, generally boosting up your contrast across all sites, but generally it will deliver. Got it. Got it. The site as it is where the, themes, I think as I’ve only tested it out once and it was a very uncomfortable experience when I put it on one of their dark themes, I put it on, it was difficult to, for me to view some of the websites because,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; they did, we’ve gone for subtlety a lot more these days. We have these kind of drop shadows to mark out little areas and we think that’s really wonderful, but they just obliterated. As soon as you go into one of these themes, you just, Yeah. You can’t tell what the area is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay. So that’s, highlighted that. So we know that one is a bit more profound than the other, let’s put it that way. Okay. prefers reduced transparency, is used to detect if a user has enabled a setting on their device to reduce. The transparent or translucent layer effects used on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching on such a setting can help improve contrast and readability for some users. Okay. Anything to add to that, or shall I go on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, nothing. We do use a lot of opacity on things, and again, it’s this sort of subtlety, which, you know. Some people just can’t see it, can they? So they want that reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yep. And then this one, which is prefers reduced data, is used to detect if a user requested that web content consumes less internet traffic. And obviously the links you’ll be able to find on the show notes and, really we’ve just. Literally scratch the surface because each of these pages will give you information not only about where it’s supported, but how to implement it along with code snippets and, what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there they are on no script show slash 10. Okay. So should we move on from there or do you want to explore that more? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s, some extra statistics that, let’s talk about the statistics. ’cause there isn’t much available If we want to know about a user’s behavior, as far as I know, I’d love it if somebody told me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can, and we’ve listed out the, Google’s own data, which is, what is browser is finding are features that have been included on the pages that they crawled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so are you basically saying that the number that we’re showing on the screen, so this one for example, is showing 32%. They’re saying that on 32% of the websites that they’re crawling, they’ve detected this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody has implemented, gosh. 32% that. Wow. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I know. And it doesn’t, really surprise me actually now because I’ve just become aware after a long time of not that dark is quite popular. More than I thought. But actually the next one, so our forced colors, which is, if we’ve got it right, is all about people who are choosing a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that people are. According to Crows, if we’ve understood it correctly, the 27% of people, so 27%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; percent of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; websites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; or pages, right? So 20% of shipped websites, things that you can go and browse on the internet, have the capability to force. You can. You can. Yeah. Or, to they honor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You know they’re going to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. That’s a better way of saying it. Yeah. Nice. Wow, that’s actually staggering. Yeah. I would’ve thought that number would’ve been in the low single digits. Yeah. but that just shows essentially what a, bad web, a bad website designer I am, these things have gotten lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and yet there they are. 27% of websites have been shipped with this so that it can be honored. Sorry, of inter, so anyway, I should say preferred color scheme, dark setting. That was 32% forced colors, 27%. You carry on down the list if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. and the next one is preferred contrast coming in at 14% or 14% of pages that they crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have some code in there that is honoring that. contrast preference, reduced motion. Now we drop down quite a lot to, 0.5%. For that, and that’s rounding up on that one. So that isn’t being used much ’cause it’s newer and not so well supported, Prefers reduced transparency. We’ve got 0.4% and finally we’ve got nothing for prefers reduced data because it’s experimental and it’s only behind flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I love what you’ve written there. Prefers reduced data. No data. that’s ideal. That’s the way it should be. but okay. That shows a precipitous drop. So the, color, the col, the bits and pieces with the coloring of the website, the dark, the light. The force color, the prefers contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s, been taken up. that is started to ship and is now, it’s getting to be in the sort of high 30, sorry, the, low thirties in some cases, but the motion ones. The transparency one. In this case real. This is new. Nobody’s going for that yet, but we know at least that it’s available in most of the browsers so it could start to become an important topic in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’m surprised the reduced motion isn’t supported so much because it’s been around for quite a while in terms of the call support and in my circles, it seems to be talked about quite a lot about using animation and an awareness generally of accessibility and wanting to, not give people problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m surprised that’s a low. I hope we’re interpreting these figures, but there’s not much on it from the users. Point of view, knowing user’s behavior. The, we’ve only got, if you like, what fellow developers are putting into their code as some indication about what’s growing and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I guess the motion one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to think of my recent browsing history, and I am really struggling to think of something that I’ve looked at in the last week where there was any animation at all. Ah, the majority of where I end up, so it’s newspapers, it’s web design, tutorials, things like that. There isn’t anything in that I can think of as animation, so I just wonder if.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message about let’s, should we just not bother with animation? Because is it really needed? I wonder if that message is coming across and so people are just not implementing it because there’s not a lot to implement. There’s not a lot to switch on or switch off ’cause they’ve foregone the option to have animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I’m pure guesswork. Yeah, it’s a really good point because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think people are more conscious about adding it, but I thought it might be included. even on. Our site. There’s a bit of animation. In fact, if you would go to the, there’s a little back to the top scroll button, and if you click on it, it animates, scrolls up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, in fact, you could probably do it if you scroll down on there. Scroll down to the bottom. to the bottom, just right there. Click that. Yeah. Yeah. And that’s, there it is. scrolling up with some animation. Now actually, if you had your preference set, it wouldn’t do that because I actually have included the code already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To, if it’s, only there, if there’s no preference, if you said that you don’t want motion, it’ll go so to the top. Straight to the top, right? So I imagine even if you are right, which I think is interesting, that’s probably coming into play as well. But I think simple things like that are often built into a lot of sites, and I would suspect it’s one of those things where you would want to use this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get rid of that for those people. Yeah. Specifically don’t want any animation, but, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I just ask you, because I know that you are implementing some of these bits and pieces, and it might be curious for the, listener or the, the viewer depending on where you come in. so how, are you actually implementing that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you mentioned that you put in the code for the, let’s say, reduced motion. Yeah. what does that look like? Where does it sit? How complicated is that to implement? And also how does the user actually set it? How do you, as a user of webpages, how do you say, I want no motion, please. How do you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:49] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to put that in your. I don’t know if it’s in the browser settings. I think this has to be in your device for this. It is just showing how little we are prepared for this. in terms of me being able to implement it, it’s very easy. I just need to put that in this particular media query. In fact, now you put me on the spot ’cause I’m just quickly trying to search now for my code on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s okay. We can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; probably go to the, oh look, isn’t that interesting? The MDN pages, which we showed a moment ago, respected my dark mode, but the Chrome platform status page, which we just clicked on, has not, it’s decided to show me it, in white. So yeah. Okay. That’s, that’s interesting. Sorry, I was buying you a bit of time there, David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:34] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s no good ’cause I still haven’t found it in my code, but it was a very simple thing to just wrap that in. basically I think I put it in a media query that was saying, has no preference, then put the scroll animation in there. and that’s, it’s as simple as that, but that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:51] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the purpose of today wasn’t to explain how to do it, it was more to illustrate the fact that these things are, available and, yeah, become more important in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however, they are, discovered by the user browsing the website. Do you wanna go on to, the bit at the bottom about more dark mode, or have you got more to say on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, no, I, think that’s it. I think I was right with, it’s a device only rather than a browser that you can set for no motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I could be wrong on that. Maybe browsers will start introducing that. yeah, there is some extra information ’cause that’s all we could really find about users’ behavior rather developers. And we’ve got a couple of quotes and I dunno how reliable they are, but you can go and check ’em out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve got earth, web. Who are saying, maybe you can read that out there. Yeah, so Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Web, the, website there, a quote that David’s found is, 81.9%, they call it 82% of smartphone users use dark mode. And that 65%, 64.6 expects expect websites to apply dark mode automatically. That figure. Seems so far skewed to that side with the experience that I have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. so I’m not gonna contest whether it’s valid or not. I’m sure that they’ve done the, polling and the research, but if I was to tell you about the people that I’ve interacted with over the last week or month. Almost nobody on their mobile device that I know has, even an inclination of what dark mode or light mode is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and everything is just in the default that the, the device ships with. but I know for my part, I have implemented that. So I am in that 65% there. but they seem surprisingly high to me. Yeah, and I’ve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; seen another, about specifically looking to people like us, people who build sites or developers, and that kind of, then it’s really high eighties, maybe even reaching nineties that I’ve seen of people who prefer dark mode, which of course is something that if you work is something like VS code to do the actual coding, you’re gonna get a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, I don’t know anybody who codes these days in. a light mode. But, so yeah, it is a surprising statistic. the only, I’ve only got one other site which went out last year where I’ve implemented dark mode and I thought we’re moving towards this. I keep hearing more and more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I’ve got all I’ve got to go on as the statistics from that is my own observations by looking at Microsoft’s clarity. Where does screen recordings? Yeah. So that’s the only thing. And I have looked through, hundreds of these screen recordings over the time and my. Estimate would be somewhere over 10% have come in and, but probably still under 20% have come in on dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, to this point, I, there’s a toggle to this point. I haven’t seen anyone swap. Use that to swap their preference. Interesting enough. Interesting. But the, but that’s much lower than what you would hear. there’s various statistics on this about promoting dark mode, which are always high, but it’s, that’s quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I think about it, that would be expected because this website we know is for. middle-aged people plus who are in the UK and primarily coming in on desktops. yeah. Yeah. So I think it’s skewed to the lower end naturally, if our, an anecdotal evidence is that it’s a big trending thing, I think amongst people, younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, from the mobiles. Okay. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, that’s an interesting point. So the demographics, the age, demographics in particular might be playing a part. Also, I, we were talking before we hit record, there isn’t really a, apart from doing it in the os, so on Mac, os, windows or Android or iOS, where you can set this up and you hope that the, the browser inherits that there isn’t really yet a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal way of doing this within a website. There, there’s this kind of toggle thing, which I’m seeing more. So top right there’s a little slider, essentially it’s a little toggle button that goes right, yeah. Or left. And it’s got a picture symbol of a moon, symbol of a sun. And you switch it on and off, but that’s not everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on some, even some big websites, even governmental websites, you don’t see it. So there isn’t yet this thing. Sometimes it’s buried in the footer. There’s no universal way of doing it. And actually I do wonder how reluctant people would, let’s say we set on the toggle in the top right. I do wonder how willing web developers will be and companies will be to give up that much real estate in the most important bit of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that toggle, because that’s where your, I don’t know, your contact us button goes or maybe your logo or something like that. So anyway, time will tell. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll just quickly cover this other from Helpful Tech. They say after 10:00 PM about 82.7, percent of users put their phone into dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I think that’s interesting because, my only real experience with. Technology that kind of automatically does that is sat navs. they, yeah, they tend to do that. And, I think, yeah, that’s probably very likely. I, you touched on something which I covered in my short video, before that, and we were, we’ve been talking about this on, I guess we should bring it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is, As I was trying to implement our light and dark mode for the, redesign of the site, I decided that we must have a toggle because it’s okay honoring those preferences that are set in someone’s device or their browser, but they may not always want it, and if they have got it set, they might not like the dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve given someone right, right on your site, and they may at different points in the day. Or different types of content want to swap. So we end up with the toggle and suddenly we have a dilemma because something which we could do with CSS, honor those people’s preferences if we want to toggle them. It, you’re gonna have to do that on a page by page basis to make the CSS that we’ve been given work. And that’s a terrible experience. So we then end up using JavaScript to store site-wide disc, preference that you’ve set, so you can turn it off and know it’s there and have the control. So we get into this and then this becomes an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a Google employee called Bramos Van Dam. It’s not in the notes here, but he has put forward a little test of a. A button that you can have in the browser. He’s been making the argument for a couple of years that this should be, the toggle button, should be a feature on a side by side basis that should be in your browser rather than every website having to reinvent the wheel, put this extra code in,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so the something equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you look on my. screen here. I’ve obviously got A load of chrome extensions here. But to the right of them are, these are browser based things. They look like extensions, but they’re actually coming from the browser. So it’s, toggling on and off the, sidebar and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His suggestion is something like this, right? That you would have a, button maybe up here in the browser and you’d click it. Click it again, on off. Dark mode, like mode, dark mode like mode. And the browser would take on the responsibility of remembering that on the no script show website you want dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you come back you’re just good to go. And that feels nice as well because that could ship, that’s one of the settings that could sync between devices. So if you’ve got Brave, I’m using Brave. if you’re using Brave on a mobile phone and another computer. It would sync that data and be able to transfer it so that your experience is the same wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like the right way of doing it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also, since finding that, I also discovered, and this is some time back, but there is an article in its link below on our other links on the show’s website, but Safari a couple of years back 2022, there was talk coming out that they were considering putting this very thing into Safari browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do think it does seem logical that they will provide this choice. It. Following the people I follow now, a lot of people have implemented light and dark modes and realized on their own designs that just leaving it to a browser or device setting isn’t enough. You need to be able to give people a toggle, and as soon as you get the toggles, you get that extra code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also get another issue with some, logos, and I’ll talk about this in a short video because suddenly you want a light and a dark mode. and you maybe have to serve up again with JavaScript, that, or do it with a background image. But with an SVG, you can include the prefers. Color scheme and you can change your SVG to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So it’d be wonderful if we can just get it down to HTML and CSS being able to, and let the browsers do the toggle for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I guess one of the things is that, so I’m just gonna scroll back up the page. So just in, in this show, we’ve covered, color schemes, reduce motion force colors, contrast transparency data, that’s quite a lot of toggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if that were to be on the website, the whole of. Discuss a whole area of toggles that you’ve gotta toggle on and off, make decisions. And if you just set that up in the browser, you know the, maybe the first time you install it, that’s part of the onboarding experience. do you typically like large light or dark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you typically want reduced motion, et cetera? Then that being handled by the browser, in every case, in every single one of those feels like the right way. To begin that journey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I wonder, the light and dark one is because I think it’s come up. all of these things you should be able to find in your device or your browser anyway, the ones that are listed, of course, it’s now with the light and dark on a site by site basis that you decide to, so I, think if you went for no data, you wouldn’t decide that you wanted that on a site by site basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. and the same as contrast. So I think it’s the light and dark mode that stands out as something different where, our behavior dictates that actually we want to be able to choose. yeah. But on a side by side basis, where the others, I’m not sure, I think they could be set in the, I. In your settings then be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. if you do have an issue with motion, then you’ll, want all of your websites. You probably want that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; everywhere. Yeah, exactly. I think that was what I was trying to say. I probably didn’t communicate it very well, but, yeah. Okay, so we’re on the 38 minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall we just wrap up with these pros and cons? Do you wanna go through that of what it means for people working. Building website. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly. There was just maybe, I think we’re both agreed on this one, but what we might get, I think it’s worth trying to implement some of these things, but what we might get is the client’s resistance on the con side here of doing anything that’s not visually on brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. that we might be some cost, versus relative returns on implementation if we all have to do and concerns about this is tech in its infancy, which I think when we’re having this debate about the, whether we should be having a switch in our browsers to switch from dark and light mode, I think it shows us how we are in an infancy with that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we were showing in, there’s a lack of data about our actual. Users are behaving. But I think the counter to that, is the thing that I’ve put on the pro, which would be responded to a user’s preferences, would probably allow us to control the branding better, because if users are going to increasingly override it with themes that they get from their browsers because they get used to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or they’re just setting things up, then you lose your control over your branding anyway. You might think it’s fine ’cause it works on yours. So I think it’s a way of doing that. I think when it comes to. the cost of these things. I think it probably as a lot of these fall under accessibility in some form or another, then implementation early on is probably going to save extra cost later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro fitting is more expensive than just doing it at the start. Always. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And I think that’s it. And I think in some ways we, can already see, we didn’t actually look at. Did we look at any of those growing statistics? It does look like everything’s on the growth. We’re moving to a more, user preference based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;web, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Some of the links that we have on this page link to the Chrome documentation and their polling, as we said, the pages, yeah. The graphs are always, inexorably rising up. They don’t seem to be going down. So this is a trend without a doubt. Yeah. Sorry, interruption. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, and I think there’s more people these days who will know about things that are already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the browsers are reading mode where you can just wipe out all of the design anyway. So I think people are, getting smarter and I, it does to me, I dunno about you. It feels like with a lot of things we are moving away from, I. How we used to look at the web, particularly, people who paid us to design websites were because they were marking out their space in this new area to do their marketing and print was what everybody knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I think where this moves us a little bit back to the fact that, the web is still, this kind of information sharing platform. Yeah. And we need to provide whatever we are selling within that framework and be part of the general web so we can give. Use us, the experience we have to fit in, if you like, with yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, direction. So I think, yeah, there’s, a big change. that’s it really. there was so much more we could have talked about in this one. I think there’s a bigger debate about the light and dark mode, but, I. I think we, this is probably, we talk long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve certainly supplied information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is pretty clear that there’s a lot that we really don’t know. but it is cutting edge. But I think what we can definitely take out of this is that this is here, it’s available, people are beginning to use it, and in some cases are using it. Not quite as a, majority, but it’s fast approaching a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, and so yeah, go and look at the show notes. Like I said, no script show slash 10 for the 10th episode. You can find all of the links there and go and explore for yourself and start having that conversation with your clients. Are we done? Yeah, we’re done. Yeah. Okay. In which case I’ll say I’ll see you on episode 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks David. Yeah, thank you. Bye-Bye bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does Baseline solve our browser support problems?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/9/" />
    <updated>2024-04-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/9/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;browser-support-before-baseline&quot;&gt;Browser support before Baseline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used a web platform where increasingly we passed the handing these considerations to third party builders and themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our local business clients only had bandwidth to care about what their own browser shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a build we may have a panel of experts (nieces and nephews who know about computers and study art at school). After that, the chances of being contacted by a visitor are slim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;evergreen-browsers-and-interoperability&quot;&gt;Evergreen browsers &amp;amp; interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core browsers, Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox are now automatically updating for users on approximately a monthly basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although these updates are up to the vendors that are all signed up to deliver what they jointly agreed to support in terms of the W3C spec for that year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some chose to run ahead with other spec not included in the last agreement. For example view transitions in Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;baseline-finding-and-understanding-it&quot;&gt;Baseline: finding and understanding it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is now rolled out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;Can I Use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/&quot;&gt;Web.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two stages: &lt;strong&gt;Newly available&lt;/strong&gt; - supported by the core browsers and &lt;strong&gt;Widely available&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 months has passed. The feature can be used by most sites without worrying about support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the MDN for Browser compatibility for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid#browser_compatibility&quot;&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; we can see it also includes information on Opera and Samsung which are not core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-baseline-cautiously&quot;&gt;Using Baseline cautiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://molily.de/browser-compatibility-baseline/&quot;&gt;article by Molily&lt;/a&gt; from 2023 where she highlights that the @layer rule was showing as &amp;quot;widely available&amp;quot; when actual support on Can I use was only (then) at 90%. Presumably this was an error as the Baseline for @layer is now set at &amp;quot;newly available&amp;quot;. Still that was quite a lot of people on a breaking feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most refer to is the Can I use site which pulls its data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.statcounter.com/&quot;&gt;Statcounter&lt;/a&gt;. This data comes from 1.5 million+ sites amounting to 5 billion page views per month. It does its best to exclude bots, but it is not clear how successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be interesting filtering the Can I use data by country which most do not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past experience of inconsistent implementation of features, not helped by vendor prefixes (ie -webkit) has probably made the majority cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if not so much new CSS has come out that we have started to work out their power when combined. WordPress may be a good example of the original cautiousness and how that may be changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Baseline partly exists to encourage people to use modern CSS. Who can resist that initial green box full of ticks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graceful-degradation-and-progressive-enhancement&quot;&gt;Graceful degradation &amp;amp; progressive enhancement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graceful degradation:&lt;/strong&gt; building for modern browsers, whilst considering the lesser experience for users of older browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive enhancement:&lt;/strong&gt; starting with a base level for all and adding extras for those modern browsers that support them (an example is the minor use of subgrid on the episode page of our site).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who prefer a more graceful degradation approach there are polyfils (JS to add in the missing features in older browsers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For progressive enhancement we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports&quot;&gt;@support&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;feature query&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-does-this-leave-us&quot;&gt;Where does this leave us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project where we want to feature new CSS and can assume the audience we want to reach will be using modern browsers, Baseline is a good reference for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we may want to employ some more progressive enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With clients much will depend on budget, the client&#39;s relative interest and anything we know about their expected traffic. Perhaps accessibility is the main consideration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/baseline&quot;&gt;Web.devs introduction to Baseline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZa3BgGaAeA&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrew&#39;s introduction video for Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal software dependencies and skills. With so much new CSS spec coming out, it seemed like a good time to have a chat about how we handle browser support. In particular baseline, which is a Google initiative introduced in 2023 that aims to make it easier for developers and other website stakeholders to understand what might be ready for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, after all these years, I don’t think we’ve ever really had a chat on browser support, have we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s because, two reasons I think. One is it’s very boring and secondly I think probably ’cause we’re a bit slack when it comes to this thing. we’ve been, actually we’ve put this on the show notes, so you might as well bring those up now, but let’s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, talking about kind of the past when it comes to this stuff now, it’s come to the forefront. I think now for us, or at least for me, because I’m back into the hand coding and there’s a whole heap of new stuff, that is coming out from the W three C and it’s hard to keep up with what browsers will support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can go into production. But, previously, for us in a way we may be, I dunno about you, Nathan, but I mean you started obviously with the hand code back in the days where we had IE six or probably even, going from IE five to IE six. Oh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; gosh, yeah. Really that far back. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; more recently, we’ve just handed over, we did hand that responsibility over increasingly to platforms that we would, as WordPress users for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we’d say, okay, the theme will take care of that kind of stuff for us, or the page builder later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think you’re right. I think if you are a core participant of this podcast, if you are really listening to this because you want to learn about modern CSS and HT ML, this stuff will matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s also quite likely that a lot of the people listening to this will never really have ENC encountered this problem. the expectation is that all the browsers are the same. It doesn’t matter whether you are using Firefox or Chrome. They all do. Broadly the same thing, and it’s got lost that in the midst of time, the browsers really, went in their own direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And then by the time that the, page builders were rising in ascendancy, certainly in the WordPress scene, a lot of that interoperability had been solved. The browser manufacturers began to talk to themselves, and so both you and I. Just handed over the responsibility of what can a browser do to our page builder tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the assumption being that if it’s built into the page builder, the builders of the page builder will have done the work of checking whether or not the things that they ship are possible. can this actually be displayed? And, yeah. and I’m still very much there. It has been a very long time since I’ve looked at this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, this is. Actually, you said it was quite a boring subject for me. It’s really interesting because I genuinely haven’t looked at this for ages, and yet if you think about it, there’s an awful lot of new stuff coming around and if we don’t know what’s possible, then there’s a, I honestly, I think there’s a significant chance that you’ll ship something which simply won’t work for a proportion of the users out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s, it is been a transition, obviously, when I first did it in the early days, hand coding, then you were always waiting. There’s a wonderful, and I’ve put a link actually on the bottom there to the introduction video by Rachel. Andrew for Google, ’cause she’s a Google employee and she actually talks about the kind of old days where you really always were waiting for a browser to finally die, so you could implement some of the new cool stuff that the later browser supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s, it is definitely worth watching that one. But, yeah, my own experience of that really was that I handed over this control slowly. in, WordPress I used to. Have a basically a, theme framework and then built my own CSS, so I had to consider it. Then when I moved to a page builder, it used Bootstrap, which had already done the thought about what it can support as a ma massive popular thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no longer did I have to consider it. So it’s come back to the forefront, not only because I’ve got the responsibility now, but also because so much has changed in the way, that we’ve now got ever. Green browsers that are pumping out monthly new features, and we’ve got so many new features coming out for CSS from the pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:50] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; can I ask you a couple of things around that? Firstly, if you are using tooling, so let’s say for example that you’re using a SaaS product like Wix or Squarespace, or if you’re using a page builder inside a CMS like WordPress, do you think you need to be bothered about this subject or do you think it is a fair assumption still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to hand that off to the developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think, I mean, if we’re doing it professionally, I think it was interesting to me, I won’t mention their name, but one page builder that kind of us up, the one that I was using, had I. Much, lower level of support for older browsers than the one that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for majority of people, perhaps they’re using it for their own personal projects and it’s not so much a worry, but I did notice that some developers there were caught short because it was ruin in the layouts for certain professional clients that they might need to have. So I think it’s still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps important to know. Yeah. this is the big problem, isn’t it? how many old browsers do we need to support, that? and I don’t think this conversation’s ever gonna solve that, but baseline does at least help us know what the majority of the main core browsers will accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:08] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. But yeah. but yeah, sorry. the other question that I had was, could you explain what an Evergreen browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; is? Because Yeah, we’re going straight up. We put in our notes here, all of these points in order, but we’re just skipping around, but, oh, sorry about, yeah. So yeah, so really, and this also ties in with something which is’ in the notes, which is this whole thing we talked about before, this idea that the key players, the core browsers, the people behind Chrome or chromium browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge, Microsoft Safari and Mozilla with Firefox all kind of got together to agree within their roles in the W three C working groups that they would implement within a year with this interoperability where they would all agree, we’re going to achieve this and we’re going to put this feature into our browsers, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s come along and I’ve forgotten what your question was. No, it was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just an explanation of what an evergreen browser is because I expect that, oh yeah. Most people don’t really even need to know ’cause of the nature of how browsers work in the operating system these days. But when, yes, when we were, beginning our journey, there was no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s just, a contrast of what that’s meant over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that’s it. they do update regularly now. they had a bit of an issue with Safaria because it was tied to the operating system that they couldn’t automatically update. But yes, it used to be a case where well updates as, Rachel Andrew mentions, There was like a two year gap or something between, yeah, I think it was IE six and seven, or was it five and six? Anyway, and that could be what you’re, you are waiting on that one to be able to change and people really, you were waiting on people’s computers to die, wouldn’t you, to Yeah. to get the next browser, because people wouldn’t do it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wouldn’t go out and update themselves unless it was. Automated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; and the updating process was a manual process, and like you said, it was a big deal. So I remember when, Firefox three came out. So back in the day when, you know, going from three to four to five to six, that was a big moment. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Google Chrome came along and I, I. I think it was the first one that kind of enforced auto updating. If you use that browser, it was just going to do it in the background so that when you restarted your computer or you switched chrome off and then restarted it, it would update and there was no hint of you need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. And that was a big moment because suddenly it meant that the browser was always up to date. If you switched your computer on and off or you, closed the browser down. And and I use a variant of Chrome. I use Brave a lot. I. And they have this process of alerting you, I suspect it’s the same in Google’s Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the top right hand corner, you get this little button, which this little green button, which says update, and you press that and you wait 10 seconds and the browser restarts. And really it’s services normal almost immediately. But that update button comes very frequently. every few weeks I’m hitting that update button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s a it, there is a real change over time and that’s meant. A lot of important things that can happen on the internet can now happen more or less instantaneously if the browsers support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, it’s interesting really because I’ve not seen many people talk about it because when you think about it, it doesn’t have give the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;browser vendors, a whole lot of control that they can just update what you are going to have. And, some of that might be about taking your data as well, with some of them. And, yeah, that’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; a good point. I can’t remember the last time I updated my browser and it offered me an option to decline something or accept something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just happens and it. Honestly, it really is, as you’ll know, it’s 10 seconds you wait, and then it’s back to exactly where you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s good for us. there’s people trying to build web pages. it’s, it’s almost impossible to advance the web and make it look good if, people are gonna stay on that old browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from our point of view, it’s a really, it’s a good thing. But, there is that other side where you think, okay. Allowing that much control to update. Yeah, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; sorry about that. I hijacked the conversation by asking what an Evergreen browser was, and we totally skipped out this bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do you wanna describe baseline? I’m guessing David, right? I’m putting my finger in the air here. I’m gonna bet that a significant proportion of people who listen to this won’t know that this exists. I know that for you it’s terribly important, but I’m guessing that baseline will be a new and interesting thing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve just seen it around and it’s only been around, I think it was May, 2023 that they introduced it. We’ll know from that video someone looks at that, but, and so it, it is pretty new. And the key thing is that they’ve been, I. rolling this out over time. So initially I think it was just on, web dev because it’s, it’s a Google thing, but it’s gone and it’s shown now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when there’s a feature, a new CSS feature mentioned on the MDN or on Can I use, which is what I think most people I know as. Go to as the website to see what browser support is for feature. It’s also baseline just now been added to all of these places. And it is, and we didn’t set this up really. We should have done so we, we can see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, I can just give you the URLO. it’s a fairly easy thing to find. The, the URL is just, if you go to web. Dev slash baseline. or you can just go to our show notes, which is, no script show slash nine ’cause this is episode nine and you can find a link to it there, but it just explains what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could put it on the screen, but it just says who’s involved and what it is. But do you wanna just paraphrase that who’s involved and what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I did. I just wanna clear something up on that though. It’s just what I meant is where it’s showing because on all of those documentation, so if you go to, can I use, now you’ve got a little bar on the top that says baseline and the a nice tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you go to the got it MDN records, so it’s gone to these three platforms. So when you arrive to learn about a new feature that you could use. In your websites, suddenly you’ve got this big best line saying, it’s saying two things. So our film, this baseline comes out and it has two stages, which is newly available, which means that it’s supported by those core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in theory, we should be able to put it into that, gives you a tick and we should be able to support it. And then we’ve got the other stage, which is widely available, which is. when 30 months have passed, that’s, as I was reading it, the feature now can be used on most sides without worrying about support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and usually when it gets to widely available, instead of just featuring the core browsers who have agreed under, The interoperability to implement things. What I’ve noticed, if you go to say the MDN records and look for more details, if you take something like Grid, which has been around for some time, you’ll see that it starts to list other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where it’s implemented in other browsers, say Samsung and, things. So it’s quite interesting. So it does add onto it, but yeah, so baseline in theory is something where we can say, okay, it’s newly available. There might be some bugs with it somewhere else, but I should be able to use this in production ’cause it’s supported by most of the browsers and if it’s widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we should be able to say, look at a client. this is what this says. This is measuring this. We should be able to use this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I was just gonna paraphrase everything that you just said, if that’s all right. the baseline is, essentially it’s a place where you can go and you can judge whether some new feature of, I’m gonna put air quotes around this, the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s say, I don’t know, something in CSS or something like that, is. Is widely supported or newly available? actually the language is newly available or widely available. Yes. If it’s newly available, then it’s probably going to be usable. But if you, if it then moves to widely available, then that means that, what did you say, 13 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s right. 30 months has passed and you can more or less go to the bank on the fact that’s gonna be supported in the browsers in question. And they are as follows as of this moment. safari on Mac Os and iOS. Interesting. Firefox on desktop and Android also. Interesting ’cause I don’t know if they have an iOS version, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome on desktop. And Android. Again, no mention of iOS there and Edge. But only on desktop. And I do know that they have an Android version and it’s, it’s had millions of downloads. So that’s the rules around which baseline is working. It’s not like a philanthropic endeavor to just make it easy to understand what you can start using with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think when you get to widely available, usually the, if you go to can I use where we usually get a sort of percentage, you usually find that’s in the high nineties. Yeah. And really you don’t find anything. I don’t, I think there’s almost next to nothing that’s a feature of CSS that’s fully supported to a hundred percent There’s always some something out of that. There is some, I think this is a great incentive and there’s a good reason behind having this baseline because clearly with evergreen browsers and monthly updates or multiple, updates coming in a month, adding new features in some of them, which won’t be in that project with interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Chrome has run ahead with some things, which they, all can, they’re all guaranteed to implement. Certain things they agree on within a year, but after that, it’s up to them. When they do that within that year and what they want to focus on outta the spec, they might jump on something which is in the spec as far as the W three C is concerned, but it’s not part of what they’ve agreed to implement altogether as the core browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think when you get to a widely available that it’s probably caught on by other browsers and end up being in the 90%. But there is a. there’s an article which was slightly critical back, last year. it’s from, and I put the link in the show notes there. It’s there. If you scroll down there, it’s an article by someone called Molly Lee, where she was, and it looks like things have been changed a little bit on there, but she was just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing out that, the at layer role, which is fairly new, was showing widely available as baseline as it’s showing in various places. But when she looked at it using, can I use it was still only supporting the. Supported by about 90% of browsers at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so what we need is a new service which combines baseline with, can I use for abstraction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, we can have a graph of does it work in baseline? Does it work in, can I use, yeah. Another layer of abstraction? No. you are basically saying there are people challenging whether or not baseline is actually keeping perfectly up to date right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think it’s, for one thing it was slightly changed when I saw it, so it seems to have been downgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure if the article has checked everything correctly or I’ve read it correctly, but it was just interesting that you can, in terms of can I use, get a percentage now most people I know. Have you got the tab there, Nathan? With I on? I have, yeah. Let me, let me, it might be worth talking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put that one on. Okay. Because before baseline, this is pretty much where, and it still is. If I watch a YouTube video, somebody will probably talk about browser support and go straight here as the place to get the statistics. And we were having a play around earlier as well, What, I don’t see many people mention, but there are some in the, under the settings, a way of being able to pull in, import the data for different areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you did that Nathan earlier? Yeah. Give&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; me audio listener. But, we’re on the, can I use.com website and the button where you can click to, alter the settings and you can add in. the thing that we did is we added in the UK as. And the United States is, data to show. But also we did play around with, the view mode a little bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, the settings are just buried here, right at the top in the, in the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; header. Yeah. And we was just in enjoying as two Brits, the facts that, Yeah. Often when we’re looking at support for many of the things that we looked at was slightly higher in the UK than it was in the us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. It’s an interesting way of pausing it though, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, we’re all using the exact same browsers. It’s just the, the cocktail of who’s using what in which country, which leads to those numbers to go up. But we’re looking, you can see at the top here, we put in grid. So we’re able to see for example, that grid support is, the further down this chart that you go, the more recent the version of that browser is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s Chrome’s latest update and edge and so on. So you can see that basically Chrome. and all the other major browsers have a green light on grid, so that is one thing that we can use. Yeah. But if we were to change grid over to something, a bit more air quotes, again, cutting edge, we might find that it’s a bit more patchy as a few more red spots here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and it’s, quite interesting. And what also, what we can see on this, for those who are watching on YouTube, is that the baseline is actually written there. So just above the title, let’s say in CSS grid layout level one, then we have, and that, that’s what baseline’s being used, it’s being represented there in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use, so you get a quick. Overview of that’s a widely supported in all major&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; route. So it’s when we’re looking at, can I use, and we’re, like I said, we’re looking at grid. Is it the fact that this looks like a tick? Is it this tick? Is that icon representative of a tick, because it also feels like it’s a logo, like the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s a tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’re not set up to do this, but it would be interesting to look at the MDN records and that, so you get a slightly more information in the little tick bar on that one. But, so it looks slightly different, but it’s been added in only quite recently that it didn’t come out with this. It too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can I use. That’s a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; very,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quick way of determining, so if that’s a tick, then we can be confident that baseline at least, is saying that there is what did we call it? It’s widely available in Chrome Edge, safari and Firefox. That’s just, you can take that in one quick hit of the eye. yeah, if you’ve got the little tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s actually really useful, isn’t it? You’d have to delve around in here. You can just see straight away if it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Alright. Thank you. One of the interesting things, we said we were gonna look into this and I did for this one, I think it was the article by Molly Lee, that actually made me aware, ’cause I often wondered this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this statistic, where did they get the data for? Can I use Yeah. Where. it’s, it is stat counter, which I’ve often looked at as well for browser support. yeah, but where do they get it from? that’s the thing now what they say, and there’s a lot of frequently asked questions, which does a good job at answering those kind of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the. I’ve got them in our show notes. The summary is that the data’s coming from, 1.5 million plus sites, which is amounting to 5 billion page views per month. And that’s what is counting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; those. It sounds like a lot, but then if you imagine, the internet as a whole, that’s probably chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in terms of the actual amount of sites being browsed and the sites available online, it’s still jaw dropping amounts of data, but I do wonder quite how, quite how accurate that is. And it’d be interesting to drill down into that one time to see which 1.5 million sites. ’cause I suppose that would matter, if it was 1000, 1 million, one point, easy for you to say, Nathan, 1.5 million very reputable sites, well great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it’s 1.5 million, very edge case, weirdy old designs from. Geo, perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:01] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. And can you imagine if it was a, say we, we looked like we were doing slightly better in the UK for support on some of the newer features, but what if that’s just the fact that there. Partners that they have in the UK are mostly putting them on tech sites where it’s likely to have people who will have modern browsers more than say something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we were talking earlier, and I was mentioning to you this kind of a, with having a bunch of clients who do counseling and psychotherapy. Wow. And looking at some of their stats wowing. Yeah. That there was such an obvious skew towards Apple product products and particularly the Safari browser. Compared to other sites that I was used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it’s something to do with that kind of middle class audience who go for, private psychotherapy who might go for that kind of products. And it’s, so I have to, so regardless of baseline. You still end up coming back to what you might know about. Yeah, I think that’s really inter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; so the demographic of that particular audience, but you can imagine that there’s a whole bunch of audiences where the de demographic skews upwards socioeconomically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re probably gonna have a different relationship with their technology. typically an iPhone is more expensive than an Android phone. And you, and actually you do find that in North America, iOS iPhones dominate the, smartphone market. Whereas if you look at other places like South America, and Africa, it’s typically Android that’s winning that battle by a massive margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you look at Europe, it’s, it’s. Smorgasbord of countries. It’s a bit of a mixture. some countries it appears that iOS and the default, I think, for many on iOS is just to use safari. And then, other countries will be Android. And so it goes. And so it’s really interesting, A, what devices are they using?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B, what’s the sort of socioeconomic impact of the niche that they’re in? And it will all skew, won’t it? So in the case that you are describing. if it’s like psychotherapy or whatever it is. The assumption there, I think that you were making was that it’s probably those people who are browsing those websites have probably got a little bit of disposable income and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a high likelihood that they’ll have a modern up-to-date device and so on and so forth. It’s really interesting, the psychology of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is as well. effectively it hasn’t made much difference. A baseline would’ve been enough probably to cover me, right? Most of ’em seem to have a more modern browser, and with interoperability, it’s not been such an issue, but sometimes that might, it did concern me a little bit because there is that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think typically we’re looking for the last two versions of the core browsers. If they’re, if they’ve been supporting it, then we pretty much feel it’s safe to go ahead with it for main production for most of us. but it did make me concerned where there might be a lot of safari knowing that some of the older iPhones cannot update, their browser, not evergreen because it’s baked into the way that the operating system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wonder to myself whether that might have an impact, whether, but obviously. I have not seen any issue. Obviously these people who can afford psychotherapy can also afford the latest iPhone. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It really is interesting. Yeah, yeah. Okay. where should we move next? Then we’ve got this other topic here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or sorry, did you finish everything about Yeah, I, we baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:37] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; cautiously. Yeah. Yeah, you did mention something again, and I don’t know if it’s in our notes. It’s not because it’s a kind of a side that we had and that was, there’s a gap in my knowledge. You were talking about the fact that there was so many other browsers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; most of them we guess are chromium, so we imagine not knowing much about browsers. This is more investigation to do, Yeah. that they would just automatically get the kind of new CSS features that come with chromium. so no issue. Yeah. That is my assumption,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; but I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But, and this is what I discovered the other day, but it always interested me that they mentioned as one of the core browsers edge, which is chromium. Yep. So you wonder, why do you need to look at that and measure that one? And I, came up with it only yesterday and I’ll be doing a video on it, on, there’s a new CSS, light and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you can actually have your light and dark preferences side by side. And I was looking at support, it’s not supportive very well at the moment, but supported in chromium but not in edge. And I thought, okay, so I don’t know anything any longer because yeah, that’s, that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; interesting because some, you would imagine that core feature would ship out of the chromium project, not only to Google’s Chrome, but to Microsoft’s edge and to any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivative of Chrome. Yeah. But there are lots of derivatives of Chrome. just to mention a few. Now actually, I don’t know that these are derivatives of Chrome, but I’m sure that some of them are. But so for example, do Go, has a browser, there’s a browser called Brave. There’s a browser called Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a browser called Safari. sorry, not Safari, Vivaldi. It ends in an eye. and they are, as far as I’m aware, they’re all chromium derivatives, but they all have a little twist on the ui. one touts itself as more developer, with developer tools baked into it, one touts itself as a bit more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s stripping out. I dunno. third party cookies or ad networks or things like that. And then there are other ones that I’ve heard of, for example, one called Sidekick. There’s a bunch that you can get on the mobile devices as well. And I don’t know whether they’re adding new things in differently. I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or taking away things differently. My assumption was that it was always like UI components or things around the edge of the browser, not the edge of the, I do. so things like the security model and the third party cookie model, but not the presentation layer, not what would be shown on the screen, which is of what, which is what is of interest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. But if Edge is doing something different with the light dark, Then something’s going on and let’s hope we don’t go back to the good old days of having to inspect every browser for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh boy. there, there is notes on that as well. Funny enough, I did actually test it and it, even though it’s saying on baseline that it’s not supported, in fact it actually was actually, it worked okay in my version, but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it, my only rationale behind it and I would love somebody to tell me what’s actually happening. I never bother to read the bug note. So is it something that, it does work natively? There’s something that Edge has done with implemented something else which has broken that particular feature. So that’s maybe why it’s listed as not working when Chrome does work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think baseline has come in and helped in many ways ’cause it gives us something we can talk about where we couldn’t before because we could talk to a client Yes. About okay, we just gotta wait for IE five to die. And and we’re almost there. dear client, we can, looks like. We’re building this, it’s gonna be a few months, we can go ahead with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can’t say the same with monthly updates. We can’t know what version we’re on with any of the browsers. We dunno what’s going on. So baseline at least solves that kind of problem first. At least we can say, look, this is some measure of what is probably production ready based on the, the, core browsers that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Now influential they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; But we still don’t get away from. What do we do about that? And there’s two approaches in a way to dealing with it anyway, if, no. Some of these are mentioned in, W three C called graceful degradation and Progressive Enhancement. Easy for you to say. I wish it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. But they, these are kind of terms that are banded around and they’re Two sides of the same coin, really. So grace, graceful degradation is the approach where you might go at building for the modern browsers whilst considering that there’s a less experience for, older browsers, but not so much caring about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then progressive enhancement is perhaps the more favored way of the people who are much cleverer than me. Of going about things where they start with the base level in the way that they built their websites, and then everything else is seen as a, an enhancement. If this browser supports it, then you know this is going to make the, experience better for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually did it on this site, on our. Episodes, and I think it’s also some, one of the other pages there was a, I put Subgrid in, which has really got enough support. Okay? And this is something that you can at least add in a certain way. It was just to put a little line between texts and separate a sort of subgrid so things were even, so if your browser didn’t support it well, things would just be a bit uneven, but the content would still be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive enhancements a little bit like that where you might run ahead with some of the things that might not be fully supported, knowing that they’re not going to break something. Could I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; posit a third option as well, which isn’t, hasn’t got an official title, but it’s non-progressive on enhancement, which basically means you only do the things which you know will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ll only implement, and I would imagine for most people, that’s gonna be the default, right? You’re not gonna spend time on a client website where money’s tight, deadlines are tight, building in a bunch of features that a tiny subset will use, but that will, swing up over time. Wouldn’t the enterprise for most people simply be to say, okay, I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just build the things that I know are gonna work. So it’s neither graceful degradation nor progressive enhancement. It’s just whatever I want to call it. It’s just build what we know works. Look at baseline, do that, come back in a year’s time, have another run at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I would argue that’s probably where the progressive enhancement people start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make sure that it works for everybody and then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. So then it’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; progressive non enhancement, if you just leave it there. You don’t enhance anything. You just do the bare minimum, if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. The pro, the progressive enhancements people might not enhance much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Exactly. but yeah, but there are, there always have been because you can see how annoying it is, To go back to the past, I think it was from IE five to IE six, you would wait just to have flipping rounded corners on stuff instead of having to cut out little images and put them round things so they look like you’ve got rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re really showing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:20] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; our age, aren’t we? And there were things like transparent PNGs. oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. Yeah. So all of that stuff, but we still got similar kind of thing happening for us now. and I think view transitions, which is only in chromium at the moment, which will come to all, but it’s not as far as I understand agreed as part of the interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you might wanna just run ahead for that because it’s so wonderfully cool. And if. Only it’s gonna happen for the people who’ve got Chrome and it seems to be about 60% people. Okay. The rest of ’em will just not get a lovely transition to their page. They’ll just get a regular transition. So that’s progressive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think at its best where it fails is, where you’ve got a feature, and that’s in the article that was looking at layers that were saying that it had less support but was. Put down as widely available. That’s a breaking feature. So effectively with layers, you’ll put in a bunch of CSS in an area, separate to where your main CSS is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those browsers who can’t read it. Suddenly won’t have that styling that you’ve put in there. So you really need to be quite smart about using that as a progressive enhancement. Yeah, it’s more of a breakable, thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It, interesting what came out of that little paragraph that you said there, the last minute or so is, I guess the progressive enhancement is all about the things which are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, for want of a better word, the things which really are transformational, you might put the time in because, having rounded corners, as we said, or a transparent image as we said, that was groundbreaking, significantly better. It, the whole experience, just everything looked better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same would be true here. You’re not gonna do those really weirdy edge cases, things that don’t really do a lot for your project, but the ones where. It’s transformational. It will take for those users who can enjoy that progressive enhancement, it will take it from a, a mere experience to, oh gosh, that’s significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s where you, maybe that’s where you put your time. You just judge what is significant, what will have the most impact, and work on those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think the graceful degradation approach is the sort of, you you’re just gonna give for the best because you’re not, it’s about the time, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new CSS functions, rounding corners, you know how painful that was to try and cut out images. Yeah. And then position them around something to create that, when you could just do it with a line of CSS with border radius, you know, so that, you might just say, okay. I’m gonna go for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna go for the latest and graceful degradation will be that they won’t get any rounded corners, It doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. But I want people to have the best stuff that’s out there. So cost comes into this. I think this is such a big topic, isn’t it? Yeah. But there are two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did put in the notes there two things that I suppose. go with the approaches, at least my interpretation. And that is that for those who might prefer a more graceful degradation approach, there’s polyfills, which is Yeah. JavaScript really, which will just, mock up the missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;features that are in older browsers, so you can get away with that, can’t you? So something’s coming in, it’s coming to W three C. You want that stuff now. You don’t want to do the alternative way of doing it. You stick it in and you find a polyfil and you use that. It doesn’t mean that you rely on JavaScript, which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progressive enhancement, people go, yeah, you need JavaScript for this CSS thing. So yeah, so it might not suit those. And then the other thing for progressive enhancement, but really long-winded is to use the at support, right? feature query as it’s called. So it’s a kinda like a media query if you like, which will say, within that you’ll say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At supports, and then you put in the things, and if the browser supports them, it’ll implement them, and if it doesn’t, it’ll ignore them. So that’s a way of being able to progressively enhance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; and just that is actually really nice, isn’t it? The fact that is even a feature. You don’t have to go through some strange way of detecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s lovely. you’ve got this option of putting things in this conditional logic basically of, is this supported? Yes. Great. Go for it. If not, then don’t. That’s nice. That’s neat. so what, so where does this is the, is the question By os do you mean os me and you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after summarizing this, I don’t, I do like baseline. I think what it is for this project, which we’re doing at the moment, our website, which is part of the show, I think it’s safe, for us to say anything that comes under baseline is good enough for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Widely available. Baseline. You going for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, newly. Newly I think as well. Alright. there might be some bugs with it. I think it’s probably, I. that’s my kind of take on it. and I think we will, as I’ve already done one with the subgrid, use some progressive enhancements. Maybe we’ll use this few transitions before it’s in the other, ’cause it’s an experimental website for people who we expect will probably jump onto modern browsers pretty early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s right. But for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; clients maybe it’s a different, with this website you can go. You can go wherever you like, can’t you? Because it’s your project. It’s like a pet project. It’s not, yeah. the basis of anybody’s business relying on this or anything. So you can do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually the fact that the subject matter of the website is exactly this gives you license to do anything you like, really go as crazy as uncut, bleeding edge as you wish, but with clients. You, are you gonna be much more, cautious, not implementing things that might work and might not, is it more widely available from baseline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean from, as we mentioned, not having to worry about it, it’s been baked into the. Builder that we’ve had, I’ve suddenly had to think about it. So last few clients I have mentioned it, it’s been one of these things that I’ve said to them, by the way, I’m gonna be building this basically with baseline in mind, almost before it came out actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but that kind of level of two b browser support on the core ones, the last two versions was enough. And I’ve been saying that to clients unless there’s other reason that’s what I’m going to do. So it won’t support some of these older browsers because I’m feeling that so much new CSS. It’s come out and that evergreen browsers, people will catch up, that it won’t be a good investment for me to hold back and do things a more complicated way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so yes, I’ve been largely saying that, but of course it’s always gonna depend, doesn’t it? As I say, if you know something about the client’s existing traffic, if it’s a rebuild, then you’ve got some insight as to what they might need to support, which might not be in keeping with what. I would ideally want to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. I guess time will tell, but it’s, there. It’s there for you to check out. Now you can go and look at baseline. I guess it’s gonna be important if you’re an agency owner or something, you’re gonna have to have a posture on this. You’re gonna have to be explaining to your clients, like David just said, how many versions back in browser, history do you want to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you’ll be having those conversations. But do you think we’ve done that one? Is the baseline episode done? Okay. That sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:53] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think that. Yeah, it’s, I just think it’s a very nice thing to be able to say to clients to say, we work to this method, rather than have to make it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say. Here we run to baseline I, yeah. Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; neat. Yeah. That’s a neat way of just pausing it, isn’t it? And then you can just give them the documentation. They can go and see. Oh, okay. That kind of offsets the responsibility. You’d have to name the browsers one at a time. It’s just to work with baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, exactly. It’s like a credential, isn’t it? There’s what you set, and then anything else is over the top, which might be needed by the client, so that, yeah. Yeah. That’s the key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That was us. That was the no script show. Number nine. If you want to, find all of the bits and pieces that we’ve been showing on the screen, go to the url, no script show slash nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to, find the episode there forward slash subscribe. If you wanna subscribe. And if you wanna find us on YouTube, you probably have, already, but it’s youtube.com/at the at symbol. No script show and and subscribe. Smash that bell, whatever it is that successful YouTubers ask you to do, that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a bunch of those things. I don’t know what they are, but, Okay. Are we done David? We are. Thanks. That was a good chat. Yeah. Perfect. Have a nice day. See you later. Yeah, you do. Bye-Bye bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focussing-on-ux&quot;&gt;Focussing on UX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web projects (particularly for the majority of low budget clients) can be hard. Even if we have defined website aims, most only have their visual preferences to guide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need to feel confident with how they are represented, but they are usually &amp;quot;sellers&amp;quot; trying to appeal to &amp;quot;buyers&amp;quot; who could be very different to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without some reference to UX (an objective approach that sees the visual site as only the tip of the design iceberg) we can lean to vanity projects that do not achieve their aims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources-to-guide-us&quot;&gt;Resources to guide us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux&quot;&gt;UX&lt;/h3&gt;

There&#39;s so much other SEO content, but too much advice that works for a while, but is not what a search engine would want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many resources, but for the ungifted, the UX approach of starting with the content and consistently applying the rules of proximity, colour and space to avoid an unconscious jarring can get us 90% there. Humans like consistent patterns. Then all we need a few eye candy embellishments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/&quot;&gt;Dribble&lt;/a&gt; allow us to &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; new design ideas, but we might want to think about how fast fashion can become unfashionable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above assumes that all know the different between what Seth Godin might call &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; marketing (traditional) and &amp;quot;Pull&amp;quot; marketing (digital).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much marketing wisdom has come from US males of a certain age. There are indications Gen Z require more authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello and welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal dependencies and skills. Last time we were defining some aims for the show’s website, which David is developing as part of. The podcast. Now we need a design to help it connect with the right audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were experts in user experience or UX and its associated disciplines such as copywriting, branding, graphic design, and SEO, we might look at each of those. In turn, we are not. So instead we’ve created a rough homepage design, or David has, and we will use this episode to critique it against what we think various expert bodies might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi David. Hi there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:51] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we’ve talked about this kind of stuff before to how to, get, get, start a design off, particularly with clients and the type of clients that you and I might have, which might be sort of small businesses that are local. We can’t really do all this stuff, which we maybe ideally would do if we were true professionals with all of this expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would go through a whole. Process, wouldn’t we? a UX process, but we’re really not gonna get clients on board with that kind of idea. Too much work upfront, particularly for the kind of budgets they have. yeah, we’ve talked about this before and I’ve found my best way is To take note of all the key points I think that might come under that umbrella of ux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so you know the key points about getting copy to clarify the, message you want to get over and other things with design, which neither of us are skilled in doing. and borrowing again from ux. we talked about this before, you don’t have to be much of a designer to put something together that looks okay, so maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could talk first a bit ’cause I put that on the show notes. I dunno if you wanna bring those up. Some of the Yeah, I can do resources and really this is my list. You might have some other things that have guided you. So I’m just looking at who we go to Get the main ideas about how to go about design, and I’ve sectioned these off over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to ux, we’ve talked about this before, I know, a book that was very influential on both of us, which was Don’t Make Me Think by Steve K Yeah, I’ve got a copy of it up there, in fact. Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It was a great, read. But do you think it’s still. Got the, message that it did, is it as powerful a book as it was back in the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’cause it’s been around for a really long time. Yeah. but I, I think nothing’s really changed. Has it? Because really the, enterprise of make me do less in every walk of life is desirable. So the, central message of that is, just don’t make me click several times when all I should do is click one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, hopefully that message is getting through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think on the metadata for their site on it, it says, as far as human need possible, your product should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory. And this is a message that we need to get to all altogether, be clear about. And that’s what we did last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were trying to talk about what we were trying to get, that our aims for this, and now we need to realize that in the most simplest way that cuts through to busy people who. view so many web pages. I think it is. He did a revisited version of his book, but that’s still quite old now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, I read that and I couldn’t remember, I couldn’t see the difference, to be honest. The main point was that don’t make, me think. It sticks with me through everything I do now. Yeah. and the other people, sorry, the, is the, Nielsen Norman Group. their resources, they’re online, lots of little videos they do on YouTube as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I should say that the page that we’re looking at, at the moment is a page that you can easily find if you go to no script show. Forward slash then the episode number. So this is episode eight, so if you go no script show slash eight, you’ll be able to find the link. So there’s the link to the, the Steve Kru book and the Nielsen, Norman group book as well, plus all of the other bits and pieces that we’re gonna mention today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, okay. Sorry, that was a slight aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:30] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it’s a good one as well because for people that are just listening to the audio, we, are gonna be looking at the, design that I’ve put together here. So we’ll try and describe it. I think it will work for audio, but, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing on that as well, on the don’t make me think a bit is the, is it’s not always the clients, how to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client is so steeped in their own business that much of what they take as second nature. So the acronyms that they use and the vocabulary that they use and the, just the industry that they’re in, it’s so self-evident to them that, this is what should go on the website because this is what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And very often that’s completely at odds with what should go on the website because obviously, the end user is typically on experienced, and so they need to be told a whole different body of things. And so that conversation is quite an important one to have is just think about. The audience are not making them think, because it’s too easy for people to slip into the, vernacular of the industry they’re in, or just assume that everybody does exactly what they do and uses, understands their business inside and out, which of course they won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I do actually put some points on the show notes there. We tried to skipped over there and it’s that. I guess it’s, we’ve often heard it, said before, and I think there’s no excuse any longer where designers would say they just ended up becoming pixel pushers for their clients and stuff who take control of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think with proper communication, we have to understand that most clients won’t have really seen things in the way that UX people do. So for UX people, the visual. Representation of the site is the tip of the UX iceberg. It’s all about what goes into that messaging and how we communicate with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And clients don’t know this, so all they’ve got when, even if we’ve set their aims with them. All they’ve really got, to understand what they’ve commissioned when they’re paying for the thing is their own eyes and what it feels like to them. But of course they have to, like you are just alluding to now, is that in many cases that the people commission in a website are the sellers trying to appeal to buyers who by that very nature will be different to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people will have different preferences to themselves. I think. Getting that over is quite important in the first place, and I think sometimes if you lead and can introduce. People to some simple things like don’t make me think and what’s behind that and what the Norman group say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get it back onto the aims all of the time and try and move it a little bit away from this subjective looking up, which we’re gonna do in a moment. Look at homepage and only judge it by. Whether it appeals to you or not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve really gotta strip yourself out of the equation, haven’t you? Because your, opinion of what everybody will like, will undoubtedly not be what everybody like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I, that’s it when we did it last time about getting to the aims. If you get the aims to people, then you’ve always got that one reference. you want this to happen, don’t you? to do that, you’ve gotta get on board the people who are gonna help you make your aims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work. So we need to understand them and walk in their shoes and that’s basically all that UX is doing is. Making us find empathy with the user. That’s all that we’re trying to do with it. so we’ve got that as our tools there. We’ve got copywriting, which is always a difficult thing, because we ask for clients for the copy, don’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if they’re small businesses, their experience of writing can maybe only be writing essays at school or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:13] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also. I think many of my clients had an expectation that the whole copy thing was under my purview. That, that was part of the, business. you, don’t go in and buy some trousers from a shop and expect to not have pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they’re gonna have pockets. That’s part of it. It’s not an add-on, and I think. Clients often thought, you’ll do the copy. We’ve had a chat. You know what my business now is, can you just write the copy? And, NN not very effectively is the answer. so you’ve got a few resources as of places where you have turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, copy bloggers got a lot of articles. that’s been going forever and it’s a huge, big website. copy Hackers was always most helpful to me. I had a series of their books, which used to help you to do things like define your value proposition, which probably the most important thing, your hero text at the beginning and the description, and to get over what you want in the simplest of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think what all of those are saying, is that you have to get over yourself, don’t you? Basically, you have to, yeah. Again. Get into the user’s shoes, use the smallest words possible, use less of them because this isn’t an article or an essay that someone’s reading. This is sales copy. It needs to be quick, for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readable for people who are gonna skim the web to see if, there’s something of interest to them. So there’s not much there. Google, SEO, I don’t suppose that really comes, I, lumped it under, user experience. I guess it’s a separate thing, but in terms of that, there’s so much stuff out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, if it’s not rooted in what Google is saying, then it’s probably something we should be wary of, Yeah, there’s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; probably a whole other episode or indeed, series of episodes on that. But yeah, Google is your guiding principle, but we’re not, gonna get into that May maybe when we look at our website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll, I think, yeah, potentially knock around a little bit, but yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Yeah. It becomes important because, we do need to get traffic, so when we design a homepage, we do need the right words in there that. Google can understand not just our users, if that’s one of our aims. So I thrown it in the same thing, visual design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;again, there’s just so many books on that. I dunno. For me, the big breakthrough was we talked really on WP builds about this before I became quite a fan of somebody who you featured on. The other thing that you do with the Page Builder Summit, Laura Elizabeth, Yeah. She introduced me to something that actually is pretty commonplace in the UX world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of, you don’t really need to be that much of a designer if you can just run through, some approach to building up your pages. So you put your content down there once you’ve got your copy down there, and then it’s about section this out using laws of proximity, color, space to, and consistency in those kind of spaces to avoid this unconscious, jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That people get, a bad design, but sometimes you can’t put your finger on it. But it’s often because there’s an inconsistency in spacing or color or things are cramped together that needs to be, have its own proximity, right? To make it stand out. So I think with a few skills like that, people like, certainly people like me who’ve really got no design skills, can manage to get something that doesn’t look too unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just a case of a few. That embellishments for a bit of eye candy, really just to make it look a little bit unique. So yeah, that’s, where we’re at, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Laura Elizabeth is well worth checking out. She does manage to explain the, components of building a website up from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s got a bunch of material out there, she’s done webinars and presentations all over the place, so definitely worth googling her and, seeing how she can. Build something that looks really credible in a very short space of time without the need for complicated, design libraries and things. It’s much more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Great. Yeah, and there’s lots of tools that we’re using now that we’ll just do things Things about getting your type right? So it’s on a scale, Yep. There’s, mass behind that because people like patterns. So if you get the patterns right, with your content and apply that in the correct way, you don’t need to be that much of a designer to make something look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my theory that No, I think you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, as we’ll see in a minute, you’ve got a really credible. Suggestion for our own page. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing for us though, I mean there are lots of sites like Dribble that share, lots of new design ideas, what people are doing, which tends to set off trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can often see there’s a move to certain things and people build on that, and then that goes forward to how people are designing. But one thing that crossed my mind is I ignore those most of the time for most of the work we’re doing, and I think we would ignore it for our. Own homepage because we would expect, as with something like WP Builds, which is still running strong now, it’s gone over quite a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you wouldn’t want something that was too much. Today’s fashion, I don’t think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, that’s interesting. So yeah, it’s not always a good idea to follow the latest trend. I, sometimes feel the latest trend is often something experimental as well, and you get the impression that it may not stand the test of time and you’ll end up in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. Feeling, oh gosh. that was a wave, which we rode for a moment and then the wave collapsed on the shore and it’s gone. And now we’re left with, something which was fun at the time, but doesn’t actually look that credible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and some of ’em, like bentos goods is, something that’s quite popular at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you’re a UX person, you’re probably going to look at that and say. That’s really bad UX because there’s no hierarchy of stuff. It’s just little boxes, So, some of them you would avoid, but I think for us you would wanna avoid nailing yourself down to something, that’s not going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably go more classic because it won’t date so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I like it. We’re gonna call our website a classic. I’m, I’m with you. Okay, got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; finally, I’ll put something down on marketing, but I don’t think again. Often when I’m, with clients, I started to use things StoryBrand, particularly as a way of introducing people simply to, the idea of how they might mark want to market themselves on the homepage, Donald Miller’s book and courses and everything else that he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are familiar with this, aren’t you? Yeah. And it’s very popular. Yeah. Yeah. I, think for something like what we’re doing, I think there’s a big flaw in it in a way. and that is that I. It’s a really good idea to be able to tell your brand as a story. So the basic idea of StoryBrand is that you define a user, your character, who has a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you define what it is, the problem that you are solving for them, who meets a guide, which is you, the website, and what it is that you do, of which you give them a call to action and they will have some success and you tell the story within your homepage of that. But some things just perhaps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:41] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m just not a story, are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna say, if you’re doing a plumbing website, it’s, it’s probably a crisis moment where you suddenly need a plumber and maybe the story’s actually just gonna get in the way. What I need is the phone number right now. But I guess that’s, there’s a story in there, isn’t there? but that there is an element of me, it’s my curmudgeonly, Northern English coming out that thinks on some occasions for some projects, things like that is, is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just overcomplicating it. does that make sense? Yeah. explain that, for some people and some industries, going to that level is, not necessary, but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; You could tell the wrong, you could tell the wrong story as well. one of. Clients who is actually a web designer himself. And he took one of his courses, he read the book, story Brandon, and applied it to his business, which is psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, the very clear story is somebody has these type of problems and they meet their guide, the psychotherapist who helps them with it. So the whole of his homepage was guided like that. And. I could see it in a way, the one thing is that it, was so ineffective for communicating anything to everybody because people who were looking for what he did already knew that story, and that’s why they wanted, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:05] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So it was all a load of blurb, which got away from explaining who they were, and anything about what was unique about what they did. So you can see how it can go wrong with it. Yeah. And there is a certain sense for me that it’s, Much of the marketing is very much US male capitalist driven approach to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see what I mean? And yeah. Oh yeah, Reflect all of the world and who you are trying to connect with. So I can see where that can go wrong. So I think marketing that side of stuff, but there is some interesting stuff. Unbounce has some, which is basically a business which is set in landing pages, but they do some remarkable content on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sorts of things on that, particularly user psychologies and stuff, which I found fascinating. But yeah, don’t think it comes in. So we talk about this homepage design, which we’ve got at the moment, which is rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. okay. So first of all, if you’re listening to this on audio, this, what’s about to follow may not work particularly well because we’re about to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describe and critique what we’ve got on the website at the moment, plus a, an initial homepage design that David’s thrown together in, I believe Figma was the software of choice. Yeah. but if you do want to go and look at the homepage that we’re talking about now, it’ll obviously be changing, but that’s no script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, but if you want to go over and look at the video that we’re gonna be. putting out the, exactly the same content that you are hearing in the podcast. You’ll hear every word the same, but you’ll be able to see it as well. ’cause it’ll be a video. You can find that if you go to youtube.com/at the at symbol and then no script show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure you need the at symbol actually in there. But anyway, there it is. youtube.com/at no script show. So you can find it from there. So what do you want me to do? Would you like me to, first of all, put the homepage that we’ve currently got on? Or do you want to go straight to your figment PF design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we’ll go straight to this thing because the homepage we got, basically it’s just one column, just dumping some stuff there. So we’ve tried to, we know that we need this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so you can see we’re on the eighth episode. You can see David’s dropped in a. an image, but if you click on that image, it’s gonna take you to the PDF version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we are. There it is, right? Yeah. So we’re gonna, we’re gonna critique this and zoom in. This is gonna be just a general chat about what we think works. We might disagree on certain points, we might not, we might agree on everything, but do you wanna just broadly paint, the picture of how you ended up here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I zoom in on one? Shall I zoom in on Yeah, zoom. Say the top of this one. The top of the, one here maybe? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So we’ve got a light and a dark version of these, each of it. ’cause we’ll have a switch that’ll take you from one. But the light version is what we’re most people should see by default when, this goes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. So there it is. There’s the light version. I’ll just try and zoom in a little bit better. Oh, there we go. That’ll do nicely. Okay, so what’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So for the people on the audio, really, on the desktop version of this, we’re going out into two columns. On the right hand side, there’s a, an icon of a podcast, mic and, with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something slapped on it, little sticker saying podcast and tutorials and articles, which is, so I, my thinking was why we need to make this look something better than what we’ve got at the moment, and it needs to communicate what’s here straight away from the no script show. So I. If we’re going to fill it into two columns, then we need something that screams podcasts. So I think that icon does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I think, that icon is like the universal symbol of podcasting where wherever you go, if you go to podcasting apps, if you go to, podcasting websites, you, just get the mic and it’s this very stylized version. It’s like a, it’s like a cop. With, with a, like a mic stock on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I should just say is, I have a, I have an Evernote extension. My browser, and we’re not promoting Evernote, that little Evernote symbol, which is there is not part of David’s design. Okay. A little, Evernote icon, which whenever a PDF crops up just pops up and says, do you wanna save this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ignore the little elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. yeah, so this is usually the problem when you go to desktop, obviously. and if you actually look a little bit to the left here, I’ve got the, sort of mobile version of that. And again, I don’t know if this is right. So we’ve got a logo and then when it goes to one column, instead of it being the second item in the second column, the podcast, mic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first one here, so I’m gonna have to reverse if you think that’s the way to do it. And you’ll notice that the design’s different. So we’ll need to use something like a picture tag where you can do art direction. So you can basically say, when it’s at this point, it’ll show this image, which is a, a more of a rectangle than the square that you’re seeing on the desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I dunno. I, my opinion would be, leave it like that. I think the, I think having the logo. Yeah. And then beneath the logo, the menu, and then an image kind of breaks it up nicely. So I’m, mousing over the bit in question. I like it that way around. So were you thinking that this image here should drop down below?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no. What I’ve done is I’ve reversed the logic of how it would naturally happen. So if we went to, so yeah. Yeah. So it would break up, it would be text, and then it would be image. Yeah. I’m not sure on this one. this is more of a job to do to. Do this version, you could just go with the same SVG and have it fall after the hero text if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel when you land on a mobile, you’ve only got a very small frame there. It might be useful to have a smaller version of the mic, so as soon as you land there, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:26] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, if you think about it, if you, were to imagine a, typical, orientation of a phone, held, in the usual way, so not landscape, but the usual portrait, it’s gonna cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about there, where the mouse is at the moment, somewhere where it’s says latest podcast episode. That’s where the, fold, if you like, is gonna be, and I think if this was a square, if this image was a square, it would be like to here. Yes. And so it’s gonna push everything down. You might lose this little section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, I don’t know. It’s, you are gonna be doing the, grunt work on making it, I think you’ve got the right intuition, having a smaller letter box, image there so that you’ve got more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:08] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s right. Yeah. that was my thinking. If we can, within the frame of most mobiles, get the key points, which is on that top hero section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively we need to get the, main text message to people, some visual representation of what’s here. So it’s quick and easy to spot. And that’s the mic. And then also our main call to action, which is gonna get people to subscribe to it either on YouTube or Apple or Spotify. And you told me that, Google Podcast, which I put in there, is about to go, so that will get Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So there’s an iteration which is forced on us by no fault of our own. Yeah. Google. Getting rid of the podcasting app, which has become quite a popular thing for Android users because it’s the default. But they’re replacing it with, YouTube music is gonna become their platform. So we’ll have to deal with that and put a, you’ve already got a YouTube logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes. So it might be that you just end up with three logos in there, or you could pick another popular, player, like something like Pocket Cast. I guess the, enterprise there would be to just to go around some of the big. Podcasts out there and see what they’re doing. see what the likes of Joe Rogan is doing with his options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes. But Apple is the big one. And then everything and YouTube, I think will be the, obviously the big one for us as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So actually we skipped over something. I’ll just mention something. we’ve, on the site, as it presently is at the moment, we’ve got, a centralized logo and the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;navigation is falling underneath it ’cause of the space. The one column, very small width. Yeah. So now stretching out, we’re going four, on the desktop, the logo left and navigation to the right. Now I’ve again gone with the. And then group, yep. two, because their research says that is the most common pattern and the one that people are able to navigate best because that’s what they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s don’t make me think, isn’t it? This is just, I guess absolutely the most standard, that logo left menu aligned right to the right, with the, the bottom, typically the furthest option on the right. Yeah. I think that’s, I think that’s exactly. The way it should be, frees up a bit of space, gets you a few centimeters of, of extra, space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interesting. I notice here that on the desktop version, you’ve got a subscribe link. as a button, but on the, and I dunno if this was just by accident, but on the mobile version, the subscribe link has gone. Yeah. And, I was thinking that actually one of the primary endeavors for us at the moment launching this podcast is to get, I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People to subscribe and it’s difficult for a podcast to make that button do anything useful because where do you send them? Do you send them to a page, which is then a bunch of other links? That’s what we’ve got at the moment. it’s got links to things like Apple Podcasts and YouTube and so on, but that is the primary thing, I suppose for us at the moment, trying to make a podcast successful is to get people to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I would petition you to keep that included in the mobile menu. I. as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not there because I just, obviously this is thrown together, so it’s not it’s a little bit clumsy, so I forgot it literally. But actually now, you’ve mentioned this, it’s made me go the opposite way and think, does it need to be there on the, on the main menu for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually it does. I think it does because I was gonna go through the whole of the page. All I was thinking on the homepage here, it perhaps didn’t need to be there. If we’ve managed to get that little block, that little subscribe block on the top, the subscribers already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Another option of course would be to just to take these ever so familiar icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think the Spotify icon is really familiar. I think the YouTube one is, I’m not so sure about the Apple Podcast icon. I just don’t know if that’s ingrained in people’s heads. No, but you often see that on websites, don’t you? Maybe. I don’t know. Here I. Somewhere very top like an extra bar, which sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is just separate with those sort of subscribe icons. you might have a Twitter handle or something like that. We’re not going down that route. This is all audio, but that might be an option as well as to is to put it, is to put those icons simply. There. I dunno. I’m conflicted about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:43] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m, yeah, I actually, you used to do, you used to want to get all this stuff above the fold on the top there and people used to stick their, social networks of, which was a bit stupid ’cause you didn’t wanna lead them away from your site. So people stop doing that. But I actually feel there’s a, I don’t know, this is personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sense is now that I ignore anything that’s icons on the top now. Okay. So I feel interesting. I feel it’s away from what I’m doing. So I feel the best places after. After your main value proposition is stated, the call to action should follow there. And that should be the one that I’m, I always feel that anything up above is a secondary thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the place where, yeah, Social icons, lazily will put up there, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I just delve into this a little bit more? is the primary thing for us on this homepage, is it to get them to YouTube? Just YouTube. not, even the podcast. apps because you are making a load of content, yeah. Which goes in this show, but it is not part of the audio feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. But you are making a load of YouTube content, so is really the whole point to drive everybody to YouTube. Even this website, like the whole website is just a function of getting people to go to YouTube where all the content would be. obviously you won’t get the transcripts and stuff like that, but what, do you think is, that the whole point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promote YouTube. Wow. I think they’ve just come up with, yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that’s really, good. yeah. Maybe we do need to rethink that call to action and make that call to action for the homepage, that it would make sense on the individual episode pages to have a bar like this underneath, A visual representation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the. I think you’re right. Actually, we’ll need to check about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So here’s the thing, is that the, podcasting space, if, you can get people to subscribe, that’s fabulous, but it’s a bit like getting people onto an email list. There’s quite a lot of steps to go through. you’ve got to have a, podcast player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to be inclined to go, there’s somehow search for it or copy and paste, a URL and it’s a silo. In that there’s no algorithm in a podcast player to promote your content. Whereas if we can get them to YouTube after a period of time will start surfacing us to people who are just browsing YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, at the end when a video is over, you will end up with. Other pieces of our content push. Now, obviously that’s completely proprietary. We have no control. YouTube could cancel us at any minute and all of those kind of things. But I think history shows YouTube’s gonna be around and it can be a very successful marketing channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for now at least, anyway, it feels YouTube is the main Dr. Main driver and the, the podcasting apps, it, that’s great, but maybe that’s not the main thrust. Yeah. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that’s, brilliant. Nathan. That’s okay. This chat was worth it just for that because you’ve just nailed it. Actually, I think we’re missing the main name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do want get ’em to, when it comes to the homepage, I think YouTube just needs to be there. I think when it comes to the individual episodes, which will be class. ’cause not all of the things that we put on YouTube is a podcast episode. So on those particular pages, then a bar like this, which just suggests you can go and listen to this in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s the solution. That’s, yeah. So we need to change that. Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. But the, but the website has massive utility because it’s a platform that we can use. Should we come up with stuff that’s non YouTube? Yeah, but also it’s gonna be the, getting back to what we were talking about earlier, it’s the SEO piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the, if somebody hears in a crowded room, somebody says, oh, you should listen to this. No, no script show, podcast. They’re gonna go to Google and type it in. And obviously we want a website to service. That and so that we can appear, but also we can do our own other things on that website, can’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can, in the future if it takes off, we can do other types of content, other things, which might never make it onto YouTube, blog posts and so on. So the website for now maybe is this driver to YouTube, but we wouldn’t give up on the website and just do YouTube. The website’s gonna be important, but, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. we, okay. Change directly a bit there. That’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So that really needs to be a typical call to action button, perhaps with the, symbol for, YouTube. But say in subscribe on YouTube, which of course we know, we can add that little extra to the URL, which can pop up the subscribe to the channel anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so this is those people who are listening. Dave, David came up with some gold. It’s really great if you appended. and I’ve actually forgotten what it is, but I think it’s query. Oh, actually, let me, where can I find that link? I can’t, but there’s a little bit that you can append. So the end of a URL, going to YouTube, which pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Would you like to subscribe modal as soon as they arrive? Do, you remember what it is? Are you able to write?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I just brought it. Yeah, I just brought it up ’cause it’s actually there on our present subscribe page. And so, obviously it’s the URL two at no script show, and then it’s, question mark, sub underscore confirmation equals one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:00] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; And if you append that to the URL, the, land, the person that lands gets asked immediately whether they want to subscribe. Now I’m, not sure whether. In the round, that’s the best UX because you’ve given them something else to do, haven’t you? But maybe at the beginning, that’s quite a useful thing to do because it’s not hard to dismiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you actually have to dismiss it by clicking some a button or can you just click elsewhere in the ui? I don’t know. Anyway. I thought that was good. I don’t know. no. Okay. I think keep it in and let’s see. See if it, yeah, we’ll see. Gets our, see if it gets our subscriber account over 59. No, that’s where we’re at right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Should we talk about the, because obviously copy came into this and I’ve put together after quite a bit of thought the best I could come up with, but I’d just be interested in your thoughts, You already suggested something that might need swapping around. So what we’ve got, for those who can’t see it, we’ve got a little, what they call an eyebrow, which is the sort of subheader, and it says, web design podcast for non-programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then below that is the main header, dis rediscovering HTML and modern with an asterisk on it, CSS. you suggested that might be better the other way round visually. Ah, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, so the order of the text I think should stay the same. In other words, that should be at the top still. so it should be exactly the same words, but my gut feeling is that’s a more useful, hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it should be bigger, because if you’re coming to this page, we’re not really rediscovering HTML and modern CSS are we’re not doing that. we are. But it’s not like we’ve invented the reinvented the wheel or anything. we’re not groundbreaking technologists or anything, but this is what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want people who are non-programmers to come and feel that they’re getting useful tips about web design. So having that as the main hook. So in other words, I think what I’m basically saying is, could we take the font size of that Yes. And apply it to that and then, just basically swap ’em around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is big. This is small. Sorry, dear listener on audio, not making any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. So basically it, it’ll be, yeah, it’ll this kind of subtitle rather than the eyebrow that we’ve got at the moment. Yeah. So the small text with us, so I’m not, entirely sure on that one. I’m just wondering we should be right in the wave of a new excitement over particularly the modern CSS, Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:40] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you made a good point. Yep. I think you’re right. There’ll be a lot of people searching for that as well. Yeah. Yeah. It’s hard to know. It’s hard to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:47] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I did do a little bit of SEO keyword research and of course what I mean, what I would normally do with a client is to see if there’s any gold dust here and there isn’t in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I try to do is to get. All of the words. So we, literally. Yeah, that’s EO gold. So, the eyebrow, technically on the code side, there’s a bit of a debate about how you’re supposed to do this when you get little eyebrow and then your main copy. Normally you say, what would you make that little eyebrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you make that a paragraph text and size it, and then make the rediscovering html and modern CSS, the header one. I think what I’m going to do or have done on other sites when I’ve done this is I’ve made it all ahead of one and put the eyebrow in a span tag, okay. All of it are the words that, search engines should be looking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So hopefully if you google this show something akin to this, at some point, all of that would pop out as the title. Okay. That’s interesting. But here you’ve put an asterisk, which is interesting. You don’t often see that. So the implication with the asterisk is that there’s more to say, where are you surfacing that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that’s going beyond the now will be changed. Call to action button. There’s a little, and that’s going to be a details tab. So there’s a little asterisk say modern CSS question mark. And what that I thought could be, and again, I dunno if my think is good on this home pages for SEO. a tricky because, you are expecting a lot of your internal links and external links to give the power to that, and effectively it’s a hub, but in some ways you do need to communicate with as much text as possible what is here, and the homepage is gonna be that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than overwhelming people with information they might not need using something like a details tab, which works like an icon, just in straight H ml, you. Add in something so I can add a bit of an explainer by what we mean by modern CSS and why that’s prompted this whole podcast in a bit of additional text, which in which I can put some other headers and some other keywords in it, but also to be useful to anybody who really, it doesn’t know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lot of people are saying modern CSS and they know that this is this new wave of, since grid and. You know so much more that we can do that we don’t need JavaScript for. That’s what people are referring to, but it needs some explanation, but it seems too much to put that explanation. A wall of text for everybody, right? Just wants to be interested in podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; The then, so this, the implication here is go, so the asterisk is go look for something else. And it’s down here. It’s just down here. Yeah. Obviously we’ll change this around. And so what is this? this is a link, like a summary. this is a click and it’ll drop down its details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary. Yeah. So it’s an accordion in effect. Okay. You’ll click on it. And I wonder if that needs to be underlined or something. I know this is a rough estimate, a rough guess, I, think I, I’ll make it look like it’s clear that like a link. Yeah. Yeah. And so then everything, like all of this, there’ll be like a all, will it be full width or you’re gonna, or just gonna occupy the same width as this and just keep that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This text. Anyway, the point is this hidden text from the eyeballs, at least anyway, which will explain a little bit more. Okay, great,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:09] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It’ll probably just fall on that side. that’s what it would do naturally in the way that the grid would be set up. I could make it fall with, but when you come to mobile, it’s gonna go to that size anyway, so Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I see. Probably just the one side, so yeah, that’s just a way of cramming in a bit of cheating in a way. It’s a bit of a way of saying to search engines, what. What this thing is that we’re doing when we’re talking about modern CSS. Okay. But hopefully it’s not too much of a cheat because it is designed to be useful for somebody who goes, what do you mean modern CSS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. can I just ask, so I’m gonna move us on quickly. To the, next bit, which is the latest podcast episode. is there a reason in this design why you, this got floated to the right as opposed to the left because we’ve got this, image which says latest podcast episode. I dunno whether I probably would’ve ended up with that over on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I feel it should be reversed. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think only, I’m literally chucking little units around. Yeah. my only feeling was there was a big on light version, a big, dark thing on our call to action, which now. I will naturally end up slipping it to the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, would feel like you, I, would go left first, so I’m the same as you in that it, but it only because it looked a little bit like it was all lopsided to the right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:33] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I can well imagine. Yeah. Sorry to the left. So we’ve got, so, far it feels like we’ve got three things going on. We’ve got go to our YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got learn a little bit about modern CSS or the, we are for non-programmers and we’re gonna be talking about HTML and CSS, and then now the third thing feels like, now play the latest episode, here’s our latest piece of content. Yeah, I guess that’s a really typical thing to do, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a podcaster or a YouTuber having the, most re recent episode on the homepage. That makes sense. I think. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also if we can bring in some of the description for that episode, again, it’s a bit more text that will Well, I, think it’s good to have your homepages changing regularly, I think for search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like to see that something is happening that you have not abandoned this page. so there’s a part of SEO thinking in doing that, particularly bringing forward the copy, not just the image link to the episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:39] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Okay. that makes perfect sense. if I was going to a podcast website, I would’ve an expectation that I’d be able to easily find the most recent piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be what I’d want to do. Yeah. Okay. Okay. and that’s gonna be a YouTube video as opposed to an audio player? yeah, because really the. The video is gonna show everything as well. Okay. And then you’ve got this little extra section, which is, that gonna be related to the most recent episode, the bit that you do that’s related to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is that just some, I don’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think, I think we’ll probably have to, I, I suspect at some point we’ll start doing the odd article as well, which will be another strand of this, just for, to cover things that maybe. Wouldn’t go in a podcast or don’t need a video or something. So there might be some other exodus, but I imagine that will be, because what we’re doing at the moment, it may not be forever, but almost for every podcast we do, I do a little short 10 minute video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Which is related to some code aspect of what we’ve been doing. as I work out that stuff most of the time. So the, there’s sort of two bits of content which are going out, at the moment, podcast every two weeks. And this. Every two weeks as well. This little 10 minute thing that I do. So we’ve got weekly content, so that’s where I put that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect we’ll change this over time, but that’s just what it’s at the moment. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:03] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; But do, would the endeavor be to give that piece of content its own page? because obviously it has already. Yeah, That’s what I mean. But there’s gonna be like some SEO benefit of cross. Cross linking, right between, the episode, let’s say episode eight and the ancillary extra bit of content that you do for episode eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re doubling the SEO footprint because you’ve got two bits of content, but they’re cross-referencing one another. boy, over time we’re gonna get. We’re gonna get so many pages, it’s gonna quickly add up. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve, put extras there, but actually it should be the tab that I’ve used for it, for the videos I’m doing is called Learn, which I, felt a bit awkward about using the Learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s learn from me. No, you’re not, because I’m learning and explaining what I’m learning. So it’s, Learn with Me is what, that section is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That sounds good to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:44:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe that’s what you should say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:01] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn with. Learn with me. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you’ve obviously got the mandatory who we are, pictures of me and you and what have you, plus the footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:45:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And also, when it comes to this, something that Google seemed to think is quite important these days is that, EEAT, which is, please don’t make me say it in full ’cause I just stumbled over it. That’s okay. You can, blank on that. It’s experience. I know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s experience, expertise. authority. I’m going to say instead of the word that they use. ’cause it just doesn’t trip well. And trust. Okay. That’s what makes it. And they want to see clear. So anything we can do now in the. In our descriptions. So when we did the WP Builds, we put comedy descriptions of ourselves, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah. And I think we probably, if we’ve got any credentials or any experience if you like. So I think our bios need writing just to signify that maybe we’ve had a few years in the game, so we might know one or two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so rather than be self-deprecating, we’re gonna actually, make, outlandish claims of our, capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:18] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think just honest ones, that we have been, in some ways I put it in yours anyway, in the sense that you’ve got other podcasts that you’ve been running for other times with mine. I just, I’m alive and live somewhere. it’s about all like a muster. But yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:46:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s gonna change over time though as well, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those images, one quick thing that’s jumping out on this design Yeah. Is is these little. How would I describe that? Like lightning bolts. You’ve got lightning bolts really everywhere. Red lightning bolts, always the same orientated, the same way, same color. What’s the, why, did you go down that route?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in my head, lightning bolts signify heat or kind of something, really? Wow. Or something like that. What was your thinking? Yeah, there wasn’t much,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:47:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; don’t make me think. Yeah, I’ll tell you what, I, nicked it. Basically, I saw somewhere else on one of the stock images that they had a mic similar to this kind of thing, and they put these little lightning bolts, electricity, out of the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think on their thing. It said something about, going live or something on there. So I just looking for embellishments because obviously we’re keeping the page simple. I just basically took. A symbol that was the lightning and replicated that. But now you’ve said it, you just think, actually it probably isn’t saying the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we maybe need some embellishments. Are different that, yeah, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:47:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know either. Yeah, no, it was just, it didn’t, it, there was no like sense of that’s weird or anything. I just thought, oh, lightning interesting. But it’s surely our podcasts are electric, aren’t they? Oh, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep it then. yeah. I dunno. I dunno. When I, whenever I think of audio, and of course we’re not just audio, are we’ve now decided that it’s really gonna be about YouTube as much as anything else. that’s video. But the audio. In my head, the iconography around audio is always like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentric circles. Think of the RSS symbol. You’ve got like these three, you’ve got three quarters of a circle, all conically aligned, getting bigger and bigger. That’s what I think of for audio. But now that it’s gonna be a YouTube channel, I dunno, I think we’ll have to revisit that. But maybe lightning is not it actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. You’ve just managed, you made me worried about, maybe you think this is really dumb, but now actually as you’ve talked more, maybe it’s not so dumb, but we could replace it with something else. ’cause it doesn’t need to symbolize audio because as you say, we’re not just audio, so we can make that any, it’s just an embellishment so the page doesn’t seem so bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:48:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. It does a good job, doesn’t it? Where you’ve got like an empty space on the left. You’ve, inserted it there and it, breaks it up. Be really, actually, I think, and again here, nice use of it there, but obviously, not needed on the, mobile version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve gone a long time and I just wonder if we should just step back one thing and just mention the, description. Do you think we’re on the right path with that? as a, this is the description on the hero bit. So after we’ve got the a web. Design podcast for non progress rediscovering HTML and modern CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve put here, and I’m not sure about this at all, Nathan, is I put CMS users, Nathan and David, revisit the web’s original page builder and ask what we can build today with minimal skills and dependencies thing that you’ve been reading out at the beginning of the episodes at the moment, and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to say who it’s for. It’s for freelancers who like to keep things simple and stay on top of web standards, which is the thing that we’re getting back to a little bit now. Do you think it Yeah, working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:49:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; The only, the, one thing that jumps out to me is if, you are like, first of all, what’s the CM CMS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, I know what a CMS is, what A CMS is, but I do, I wonder if anybody else knows what a CMS is. you probably do if you’re listening to this to be honest, but maybe a casual user who’s. Starting out on their journey of creating websites won’t know what that is, so that might throw them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe that rather, maybe that would say WordPress even. I could, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I could put little abbreviation in HTML on it, so it has a little, however you style it. So when you hover for it, it tells you it’s content management system. But that of course itself is a little bit, I, in all honesty, I think I was five years of using WordPress before I knew what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content management system meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:50:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But the, but you’ve obviously felt it’s important to get our names in there right at the beginning. So you’ve put our names, who we are. I think that’s, there’s probably some utility in that. and minimal skills and dependencies. Yes. Again, would people know what a dependency was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Yeah, but the second sentence, maybe the second sentence, would work really well as the first sentence, so rediscovering HTML and modern CSS. It’s for freelancers who like to keep things simple and stay on top of web standards. CMS users, Nathan and David revisit the webs, blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right. You’re right again. I’ve never been More than twice in an hour. This is getting ridiculous. Yeah. maybe, but I, yeah, maybe just flip that around and see how it scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:51:42] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, no, I think you’re probably right there. We might, yeah. The CMS users was the problem. I just thought you wanted to tell a bit of a, is again, this storytelling idea, this idea that’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people here that you can join their journey with. yeah, I didn’t know how to say that in ways that represented that properly, but CMS was the CMS users, pace Builder users. It’s, it can’t imply, ’cause that’s wrong that we’ve left CMS, so you can’t write it in that way, but it needs to show that you come from a background looking at this with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those kind of eyes. ’cause that’s the truth. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:16] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Would negative language work well there? So, something like, join, so the, you just mentioned joining us. Join, David and Nathan, as they get away from using, get away from using, software. No. Get away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:52:38] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, That’s what I was trying to avoid because it is not fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I’m, you are using WordPress it No, and I’m not away using WordPress either, exactly. Neither of us are really moving away from this work, but, I am to, to a greater degree in the sense that the work that I have doesn’t need it so much. So that’s the exploration, but. But you don’t want it to imply that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, maybe it’s one to think about. That was the best I could come up with. ’cause I thought I’m stumbling over the wrong things. But it felt like it needed to tell a story. You needed to join us as we did a particular, because that’s the uniqueness of the take of what we’re doing. If you want to learn CSS and HML, the far better people than us, but you might be someone who’s in our shoes going through that journey where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, you’ve got a bit outta touch with that stuff ’cause you’ve been so focused on the CMS or whatever that have skipped that. So I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:53:29] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; wanted to get that in, but yeah. Yeah, maybe, let’s see, let’s iterate on that over time. But, yeah. Shall I’ll just reiterate what’s going on here. So this is a, PDF image that we’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I just click. Backwards and go to the no script show slash eight page. So that’s episode eight. You’ll be able to, down or find that by clicking on the image where it says initial homepage design, so you’ll be able to find it there. but I, are we done? Is that, have we done enough? yes, we’ve been on for gazing our own stuff for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the audio, folk. I apologize. But, it, is what it is. Go and have a look on the no script show website and, you’ll be able to see everything. It’s turned out to be quite a long episode, so apologies for that as well. I will take that off the screen. Are we just knocking it on the head there and saying goodbye? See you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:54:25] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we didn’t talk about what we could do next time, but maybe we will. I think one thing we’ll want to talk about other pages and features, but maybe, I don’t know, just for something different, we might want to, one of my interests is, I dunno if it’s yours, it’s browser support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we supposed to support these days with all this modern CSS out there? Gosh, we’ve, we have a new tool baseline, which is supposed to sell us. Which things we can use and we have, can I use site? Which tells us, but in all honesty, I think we need to investigate this. ’cause I band it about, I hear other people talk about these things as their clues to what they should support and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, I, really don’t understand it enough. So maybe we should talk about that next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Right? In which case, I’m gonna dig out my trench coat and magnifying glass so that we can give it a thorough investigation next time. That will be episode nine, but, for today, episode eight is a wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, David, for joining me today. That really appre, really enjoyed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:20] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, me too. Okay, bye everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:55:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How do we start a website project?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/7/" />
    <updated>2024-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/7/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-notes&quot;&gt;Show Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The perfect project management system only lives in the abstract. Communication and technology evolves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although self indulgent, we have a live project where we get to look at things from both a designer and client&#39;s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a shift in design to soft skills and agile approaches. More human than AI and more scientific to attempt to &amp;quot;falsify&amp;quot; (than to rigidly hold to old beliefs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-questions&quot;&gt;Three Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDN web docs has a short article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Design_and_accessibility/Thinking_before_coding&quot;&gt;How do I start to design my website?&lt;/a&gt; that talks about &amp;quot;project ideation&amp;quot; in plain english. It asks us 3 questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What exactly do I want to accomplish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will a website help me reach my goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote is from the MDN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side. Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is what you want to accomplish. Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from lack of goals and vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-clients-brief&quot;&gt;A client&#39;s brief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we ask for and get answers to these questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we get useful answers or need to prompt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we challenge the answers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script web show about modern web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal dependencies and skills. Up until now, we’ve been catching up with the new spec that has been coming to the web platform over recent years, particularly with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re probably less than halfway through that, but we’re also building the show website as part of the podcast, and we thought it’d be interesting to take a step back from the technical side. For a while and look at how we should start or any new web project. As always, I’m joined by my good friend David Waumsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you doing, David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’m very good. Actually, I should just say no, shall I tell you about my bunions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:46] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, go on. let’s spend half an hour talking about that. Actually, I don’t. I don’t even know what a bunion is, but anyway. no, but it’s a very typical British complaint. so the intention of this show, right from the outset was to talk about modern things that are coming down, especially from the W three C-C-S-S-H-T-M-L and so on, and to upskill you, but particularly me, because your levels of skill of are far in excessive mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are driving the whole thing. But an interesting idea that you had right from the outset was that we would make a website. almost like a co-host for the show. So there’s me and there’s you. And the website is host number three. And if you are listening to this and haven’t been following long, every time that we’ve done a show, you can find the episode related to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the website is no script show. This is episode seven, so simply append slash seven to the end. So no script show slash seven, and the website has been iterating slowly. and this, really, this episode is about that website and asking the question about, what’s going on? Why do we need a website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So we’ve still taking a step back ’cause we’ve got our website out. Yeah. And now we’ve gotta decide who it’s for and do the design stuff. ’cause that’s really where we start. We started with clients and and we had to ask ’em why they wanted their website and we now we’ve got a perfect opportunity even though it’s a bit self-indulgent, I dunno what this episode’s gonna be like, but it does give us a live project where we can look at things from both the designer and the client perspective as we are both Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So shall I pop it on the screen? Yeah, actually that’s, that would be useful. Our show notes. First of all, I should say, dear listener, If you are listening to this, maybe quite of the things, quite a lot of the things that we’re gonna mention in this podcast episode are related to what you’re seeing on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find us. On, YouTube, if you go to the URLI mentioned previously, no doubt there will be a link to the video. so you’ll be able to see what we’re talking about, but bear with us. Hopefully we’ll manage to do it in an audio form as well. So there it is, there is our fully featured, finished complete, and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to fix websites. It’s pretty bare bones, isn’t it? Other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. It’s just functional. Yeah. because we didn’t do what anything I think you would expect to do for that would be classed as a design process. And here was the thing, because we decided for this podcast, we would take our source of truth for everything we talked about being the W three C, but when it comes to design, I’m not sure what that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought. How do we start a web project? Who will we go to first? And I thought, the next best thing might be the NDN records that have a short article, which is called How Do I Start To Design My Website? And it doesn’t mention the term project ideation, which is a really fancy term, but the rest of it’s really plain English and it’s basically asks us three questions which we need to answer for ourselves, Nathan, about we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to ask it of ourselves and answer it. So do you wanna read out the three questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:55] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So here we are. So this is, like David said, you can find a link to the MDN article. It’s really easy to read. It’s probably like a, 10 minute read max, but it lays out a process, it’s a wiki, as I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not the, it’s not the knowledge from a singular individual. It’s been changed and modified over time. So the three questions, I guess in the, in this order are. What do I want to accomplish? What, sorry? How will a website help me reach my goals? And thirdly, what needs to be done and in what order to reach my goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is the intention in this episode, David, to try and answer those three questions from our perspective? Running a podcast, running a YouTube channel, and the resultant website? Is that why we’re here today? Yeah, we’re trying to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that. we’re trying to put ourselves through this, but it’s worth talking a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we did earlier, and this is where we might ramble on about, these are the questions according to this document that we really should have been asking all the time when we had clients come into us and we’re starting the website. But I think, honestly, you and I tended to do what this MDN record says is that we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the technicals and then, and skip over the very fact that we need to know why we’re doing this and for who, so yeah, we have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I just thought those three questions are really difficult. As somebody who, let’s say you are commissioned to build the, they want you to come and build their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask these three questions that you must answer these questions for me before I’ll build a single thing. And you’d probably lose the job,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; wouldn’t you? I think they’re okay. So in principle, they sound like easy questions to answer. Yeah. And if you really applied some thought, they probably are fairly straightforward to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s a couple of things around this. Firstly, exactly as you said. My goal was to get people on the phone, then turn that into a meeting of some kind. And at that meeting, I probably should have got into this process of asking these questions. But usually I skipped all of that and ended up in a conversation about here’s how we technically do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in my case, obviously, if you know anything about the stuff that David and I have done in the past, we are very heavily into WordPress and page builders. So that would be the thing. I’d show them the page builder and oh, we could do this, we could do this. But it wasn’t really about, why do we need to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do you want to accomplish your goals? And anytime I got even close to asking questions like that, it became immediately obvious that I was putting people on the spot and that they needed time. Yes. To think about this and not be just confronted with it live well. What do you wanna accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I want a website. that’s the answer, right? That’s the exact answer that’s gonna come out if you just put somebody on the spot. Whereas if you gave them a week to think about it, I don’t know, an email exchange or a prior meeting where you tell them that you’re gonna dump these questions onto them, maybe the answers would come out differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in our shared Google Docs, I said, if you go into a shop and the intention is to buy clothes, you don’t expect to be interrogated about why you want the clothes. I’d like to buy a shirt. Why do you need a shirt? What’s the point of the shirt? How are you going to deploy the shirt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s it gonna be you? You get the point, you just want to go in, pay for the money, get the finished product, in this case a shirt, read website and then get out again. And I imagine that’s the journey for most clients getting a website. A lot of them haven’t thought about this, haven’t imagined that they’re going to have to think about this, so I never, ever did that particularly effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:48] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that, that was really good actually. And I think I avoided talking about these things for most of the time I had clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s only quite recently that I’ve realized I do need to get to this and I need to think about it. So I think there’s two issues with this is firstly that none of us are used to being asked why we do the business we do, and and. Do that soul searching. We’re not expecting that and we’re, we don’t often find the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumble into things, so we’re not used to that. And then we’re also, in a way, we’re being asked. To provide information about who we are, what do we stand for, why do people like us, that’s something we’re not used to or don’t necessarily know about ourselves, which we need to dig into if we’re going to represent that client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they’re not used to it on one hand. And then there’s also the issue, as you said, with buying trousers. That’s pretty easy. And it’s different from the communication of a web, which is an ongoing project to communicate something. So when you put your trousers on, pretty much if they fit and they seem pretty durable and they look fashionable to you, you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the website’s never going to be consistently fashionable. It’s, never going to need to, what suits you. But we need to, as designers, need to be able to design those trouss for you when it comes to a website. And, I think it’s a, very different kind of thing and I’ve recently learned a bit to make sure that these indirectly are the questions I’m asking from the first conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:22] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So, my shirt analogy, I’m going to liken us to a high street shop Yes. Where you walk in and you just want to get the thing and walk out. Whereas really what we need to be is a bit more of a tailor. We need to be Yes. there is no shirt. Available. You just show up to the shop and the tailor then asks you a bunch of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;probably not. yeah, probably a bunch of questions, but then we’ll also measure you up and do all of that due diligence, and then you’ll come back a bit later and the shirt will be ready to go. So it’s a bit more of a tailored experience. Do you know I’m very happy with, that metaphor. Yeah. I’m gonna,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:58] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, and I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’re asking the same questions. what kind of occasion is this? For The background. What people expecting of you outta that. So it’s just Yeah, like a tailor. It is very much like that. but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; still, I think that if you just dump that into the conversation and those questions are perfect, but if you dump that into the conversation, I feel that you are gonna force the person to flounder around because they probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t have to hand what the list of things they want to accomplish is, and it’s interesting in the MDN article, they get, they give an example of a fictional, client if you like, and they, end up drawing a list out. And, some of the items are expected. What do you want to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of them is, I want to get a new apartment. So there’s this economic incentive to make the website work for them so that at some point they’ve got this excess of money and they can move into a bigger apartment. of course that’s great, but then you need to refine that and think, do you know what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t really do that in the website design. There isn’t a bit of it, which, will get you an apartment, so we can just jet us on that. But then some of the other answers that come out may be able to be used and put in a different order and so on. So I, think just. Sticking ’em all down, in that, conversation that you have, but not expecting them to do it straight away because who knows, maybe they’ve just been dumped on by their boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, it’s your job to get the website. maybe they’re new to the company. Maybe they have no idea what the company ethos or mission statement is. So I think that whole thing just needs to be spread out over time somehow. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve got an advantage because we know how the web works and yeah, when we come, we’ll turn back to answering our own questions, with this, but we’ve got an expectation of how the web works, which is basically, we’re doing this because we know the more we put out, the more it will help the website grow where a lot of people have a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very much a brochure site, which isn’t gonna be added to all the time. And in that sense, I’ve often started asking these questions in an indirect way to get around this, which is, can I explain to you how I understand the web will work and how it might suit I. Your business, what it might be able to do for you, which often gets me starting about the messaging and the SEO and let me do a little bit of research to see if you’ve got a lot of competition for your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are talking about a certain typical client that we would get. other people, big organizations might be able to answer these questions in their company ethos, but when it’s often a single client that we’ve got who’s operating their business locally, they don’t know what the web is, they just know people have a website, they know what they look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they say, yeah. What a website. like that sends people business like they’ve got. And then we have to start from a different point of view, don’t we? Where we have to say, let me explain how I think the web works and the competition you’ve got and how you might be able to find your own little niche in there to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; people to come to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that chasm can be really profoundly wide. Yeah. Because you and I are addicted to the internet, we’ve spent the last 20 years or so really obsessing about it and I’m sure a lot of detail is passed us by. In fact, I know for both of us, there’s a lot of detail that’s passed us by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point is we’re, at least oay with it. What a website can achieve, what’s possible, what’s not possible, and. Typically the clients that I would, encounter were entirely obsessed about their own business. So whether that’s being a farmer or being a shop owner or being a lawyer, that’s what they’re obsessing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so they don’t know. So the process of explaining what can be done in the modern web and how it might help you to reach your goals, I think again, is another conversation that needs to be had, and you need to have. As part of your arsenal in that conversation, all of the different things that can be accomplished can be brought to bear from a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s reasonable given a budget, what’s reasonable given the amount of, the geographical location that they’re in, or the demographic of the people that they’re hoping to talk to? Yeah, so I, I think you’re right. There’s, a big, chasm there, Yeah. There’s no, you shouldn’t expect that they all are nerds of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:13] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and there isn’t, there isn’t one perfect system is there for this. I, with a lot of the clients that have been around recently, it’s often a new site for new business in the local area where they do multiple things. And it might be in their interest to focus on one of those things that they love the most and sometimes the, last case I was mentioning to you is somebody who did multiple things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I looked at their SEO, because they needed to get people as a new startup just to see what the competition was like, it seemed that the searches for one particular thing that they did would be the best thing to concentrate on because everybody else. Concentrated on the multiple of things that profession did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and what I wouldn’t have known without that research, knowing that they wanted traffic was going to be the first thing is that when I put to them this, they said, oh, that’s perfect ’cause that’s really what I wanna focus on. So the website became. Very much a different thing just for that whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it did get them down to, indirectly, to what they wanted to accomplish. They didn’t say it, they kept it generic to me in the first place that almost the statistics had to pull out what, they really wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It’ll be interesting to see, and I’m more or less certain that in every case, the answer that you’ll get or the answers plural, that you’ll get out of a client will be very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah, ultimately we want a website. At some point that’s got to crop up, but the incentives about what they want to accomplish will be different. e even with businesses that are in the same sphere doing a thing which is adjacent to another business, just the personal preferences of the person and the stuff going on in their life will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will mean that they’ve got different agendas. Do you feel that we’ve tackled a bit of that Second question. How will a website help me reach my goals? Is that the bit that we were talking about where we explain back to the client what the, what a website can achieve? Is that, did we cover it often enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess that’s, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; What I’m starting with, isn’t it? When I’ve been doing it recently, it’s been the second question indirectly. So I’ve never asked these questions of anybody or myself, which we’ll do in a minute. But yeah, I guess the, my approach has often been explaining first what I think a website might be able to do for them, uhhuh within their budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are right. I’m giving them the answer if you like, or rather I explain my perspective on what I think I could do for them and what I think we should look at. And then. They come up with their own answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It certainly feels like the first question is you the, website developer builder asking the client, and it feels like the second one is more you telling the client I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is trying to get information from you, and the second one is more, okay, I know this much about the internet, I’ve got this knowledge about what’s possible and I can, give you help about how you can reach a goal. So it feels like it’s more of a, the first one is more getting, the second one is more giving, but then the third one, what needs to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess at this point, you’re in a collaboration, aren’t you? And you need to figure that out between you and put things in the right order and set goals. Yeah. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:14] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that’s actually a very good way of looking at that. So it does lead the third question in this does lead us to what we’re going to do on the site, what content we’re gonna have, number of pages, what assets need to be there, whether there needs to be some media or not, or some forms or whatever that will all come into their one needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is more practical, should we try and do this for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:35] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; ourselves. Okay. This is gonna be painful. so the idea is that we’re gonna ask the questions about. About this podcast and related website, and we have talked about it. Whether or not these are the kind of answers you’d like from a client, who knows, but we’re gonna be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re gonna say it as it is. all right, where do we begin? yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:00] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; so what exactly do we want to accomplish with doing? we’re looking at the site really, but it is the whole podcast itself. But yeah, we’re doing that. Okay. Do you want me to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; start? I’ll ask you the question and then you can answer it with your little bullet pointed list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve put a lot more thought into this than I have. Mine is far more like off the cuff. You wrote down a whole load of things that backed it all up, but, okay. So David Worsley, you want a new website. what exactly do you want to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:33] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Dare you ask. Just bill me. It’s gone wrong already. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant. no, yeah, so yeah, so I did have a bit, it is a really good questions ’cause it does make you think, and in some ways we did start this when we said we’ll do this together and, my first thought, and it’s the first thing is that I’m doing it because I have to go in public and learn the stuff which I’m trying to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this podcast has all been about learning all the new CSS stuff and I’ve needed to do that and. Doing something with you, it forces me to an agenda where I can’t cheat myself out learning if I’m gonna talk about it. I need to know a little bit about it, and so I’ll work harder at learning. So that’s the primary goal,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the principle there, it’s a bit like if you’re learning a coding language, there’s no point in just reading a book. you have to read the book and then do it. Yes. You have to take what you’ve learned, and then put it in, apply it. So it’s a bit like that. Okay. That’s a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Yeah. Okay. But there’s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I’ll run through ’em quickly. partly because in our industry I was mentioning to you about how Rachel Andrew, who’s been teaching HTML and CSS since the nineties, it is very much encouraging of everybody to go out there and try and teach people, as part of their learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because everybody is different in how they learn. So you might communicate with somebody something that she couldn’t or something. So I think it’s encouraged in our industry anyway, which builds onto the next. Reason for doing this is the building of connections. Perhaps by putting yourself out publicly with other peers who might be in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nice. and, I think that is it for me. it’s we did WordPress all that time together and, still might be, I’ll be building some WordPress sites, but if I want to step outside of that support network, which I’ve been in for what, 17 years or something, and do something different, then I need to build up connections with people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is one way of being able to do that. Maybe somebody watch stuff and relate to what I’m going through. So there’s that side of it, and then, yeah. There is one more thing. I guess putting some content out might be useful indirectly for money in the sense that it gives me a, it’s good for my brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if clients aren’t interested, they could see the fact that I’m transparent in what I do and I put out content on the thing that I do. So I’m sure they’re not very interested in these things, but the idea that you are out there talking about what you do as a profession probably does lift you up in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that’s interesting. gaining new knowledge, building connections with peers in, a, way you can short circuit it because you’ve, maybe they’ll come to you having watched some video content or something like that. So that’s interesting. And then also there’s a possibility for some future project where you might build something and wish to, wish to put that into the hands of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. shall I do mine? Yes, please. Okay. Mine are in no particular order. and some of them are very frivolous, but, this is frivolous, but I’m gonna say it, it’s a bit like the, I want a new apartment, one that we mentioned from the WDN article. I just wanted to carry on talking to you. E every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked for like over a nearly a decade. Not over a decade. And I wanted that to carry on. So that’s a very personal one. I wanted that whole experience to continue. ’cause the idea of not talking to you each week, ’cause we have quite a lot of fun. we speak Yeah. off the camera and we speak for a long time before we hit record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s a very personal one. But that’s important. I think the, gaining knowledge in an area where I know I wouldn’t have put the effort in. Is nice as well because I’m in the WordPress space and a lot of the WordPress tools that I’m using allow me to bypass learning new things in the W three C spec, HTML, the new CSS that’s coming along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this is forcing me. To, I’m not really implementing it, but it’s at least confronting me with it. Maybe it’ll force me to implement it as well. So there’s that, step outside. So this is a little bit like you making connections with peers, step outside of a community that I’m really familiar with and maybe make some connections with some people that I’m unfamiliar with and, who knows where that’ll take you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno quite how that’ll happen, but history shows doing the. Podcast that I didn’t, that I still continue to do in the WordPress space, just tells me I have an intuition that things just happen unexpectedly. And so the, my last one, my fourth one is, yeah, just see what new opportunities come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m a firm believer in serendipity and putting content out without necessarily an agenda for, we want this many followers or we want this many people on an email list or anything like that. It history shows that things happen unexpectedly and, opportunities arise. And so that’s also gonna be interesting for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mine are far less, far more, ephemeral I think than yours, but they are the real reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And your first one, which was very kind is part, is really a major one for me as well. We’ve stopped doing the other podcast and it’s only like a week when it’s I’ve guilted you into saying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel, proud that No, It’s absolutely, that is one of the things because there’s a missing gap, but it, there was a use. So I think that’s it. We haven’t got any, exact, and of course these things may change over time. I think with anything you ask the question for us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly do we want to accomplish? But I think these are questions you would need to keep circling around because they’re bound to change. As we change businesses, change, things happen. Websites need to change, forms of communication change. So I think, yeah, so yeah, that’s, that sums up what do we want to get out it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So money hasn’t come as the main thing, but it may have an opportunity to deliver something because you found a skill in podcasting and interviewing people that could. Be expanded out beyond what you’ve got. And I’ve got a way of forcing me to learn stuff and meet people. What about,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we’ve maybe smuggled in money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. under the banner of, you called it looking a, way ahead. Yes. Yes. and this idea that maybe you could do templates. And I had this idea of future opportunities. So I think we’ve smuggled in the opportunity for this podcast to make some revenue, but it’s it’s not high on either of our agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so it’s. It’s maybe something, but anyway, yes. Yeah, sorry. So we’re on to the next one. I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s, yeah, it’s very much part of our profession, I think, to put that stuff out there. And yeah, you’ve found like everybody, I think, who goes into code and that you do it as a hobby and it seems to grow into a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it’s the same as talking about it as well. Yeah. Things grow out of it. So we’re different from a lot of industries in that way. So yeah. The next question is, so what needs to be done? Oh, hang on. If I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:32] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; jumped one. No, yeah, you missed one. How will a website help me with my goals? So that’s the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, I’ll hand it over to you again. You’ve given it some thought and putting some bullet points and then yeah, it gets a bit waffly on this one. So effectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m repeating myself ’cause I’m big to, I’m a big fan of the idea of. A website that constantly develops an agile approach. That’s a big thing that I’m into, and this is really the only project that I’ve got that can be like that, that can keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t keep doing that to clients or encourage them to keep changing. So this is an agile project where I can learn from doing the website itself. And I already covered these in a way. In the sense that it’s a way of building up some social proof and trust that will help me with my goals with the clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a bit of, it’s a sort of bit of branding about my transparency. That’s what it’s gonna help me reach the goals of, be more creditable to clients. And then really it is about the fact that there is a potential to. Other source of income, perhaps through peers rather than just clients only. If I can come up with some stuff that I’m going to use to make my projects easier, I’m going to share that most likely for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there might be something that might come outta that in terms of support where that, might be some way to monetize that, but there’s not an idea behind that. So in that’s me, really, it’s the how will it help me achieve my goals. It’s the doing of it is. Itself, the building and the constantly building and iterating on is it, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Mine are, I think mine are much more easy to, map because, so my first one was, having fun chats with you. we’re seven episodes in, so that’s already been ticked off. So it’s already proving, it’s worth there, gain knowledge and about something future orientated. again, that’s done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, one interesting thing that I. I haven’t yet really implemented anything, so I’m keen to see if I can bridge that gap. If I can make time in my week to actually implement some of the bits and pieces that I’m gonna do, step outside of a community that I’m familiar with. I don’t know how that’s gonna work out with this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve literally no idea. We haven’t, as far as I know, we haven’t got a contact form, which allows people to get to me in that way, or, I don’t know that we’re pushing this out into social channels, so maybe that’s something we could explore in the future. and the seeing what opportunities come out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s just, that’s like blue sky thinking. I’m just, if the more we keep doing it, yeah. Maybe some of those opportunities will come along. Like I said, with a bit of serendipity. It’s not gonna be me pushing it ’cause I’ve got other things to do during the week. You never know. Maybe once we get 20, 30 episodes in, this’ll become more important in my week and we’ll have to, manage how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that’s the answers that I’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Should we move to the third and final question? Which is what needs to be done in what order to reach my goals? So our goals Yeah. Are fairly vague ones, but I’ve got some ideas for this. Yeah. And this is probably what we’ll need. I think we’ll need to lead this on into another episode on this as we get into how we’re going to design this website to reflect what we’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the first thing for me was that we need clearer messages. So we put up this site just to have something to dump the episodes there. We’ve got this thing at the beginning on the homepage that says. For people who build websites. it’s so vague and not really true. That’s such a massive number of people, but actually we only reflect a small number of those people who build websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we probably need a bit of audience targeting. We need to find people who are like. With our messaging, so That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; So maybe more conversation, maybe more text about W three C or CSS or web standards or something like that. Yeah, Okay. So refine it. Refine it. Yeah. For me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:32] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. for me it would be the fact that I need to probably, it might be different for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about that, but it, I would think I need to communicate the fact that it is for people who kind of learning to be able to build these static sites from, a. From a platform that’s been dynamic that you’re used to. So I think it’s connected to those people who have lost touch with the, that sort of stuff like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So some message rather than just for people who build websites, we’ll probably need to get some messages. So that would be the thing that needs to be done next. What do you think needs to be done next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:30:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the, I think you’re absolutely right. the whole branding thing, which I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, we literally did start this just as a project and we WI don’t think I was thinking about the audience at all. I was really thinking about, oh great, let’s just do some more content. Let’s just see how that goes. But now that we’ve done it a few times and it’s, it’s consuming parts of the week and all that, it will be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think messaging is exactly right. I think you are taking on the heavy lifting, all the lifting of the website, but I’m sure at some point. You’re gonna want to, to address that because with the best will in the world, I’ve got a feeling that the website won’t look like this, in a, I don’t know, five months time or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure it’ll iterate a lot. So maybe, that’s, I think what needs to be done, is to, pretty fire it so that anybody jumping in isn’t put off with, oh, it’s all black and white. These guys dunno what they’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think we still have a connection with, you’re still doing a podcast for WordPress and I’m still very much connected and follow the news in that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a kind of like within that as well, even within that community, there’s a lot of people who, with us with the page builders, we like not dealing with code. There’s a lot more people who go, oh, I do need to learn a lot of the code and that’s going on at the moment, and some projects I might just need to be able to not use my platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I still primarily use that platform and it’s that connection people, I think there may be a lot of people who just wanna get back to go, okay, what would I do in VS code if I needed to do this again? it’s that kind of, connection that I would like to communicate in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, do you know one thing that I think would be important to, to. Align with those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:31:54] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. One thing that we haven’t mentioned in this episode or much in the other episodes is that you are also taking this as an opportunity to create, your own YouTube content around what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And, so that’s important and it will touch on the stuff that we cover in the episode. So for example, if, the stuff that. So it, the podcast that we’re doing, if it’s episode number five, if you go to our YouTube channel, the, YouTube cover art will look in a certain way for the podcast and it’ll have a five in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve also noticed that you’ve got a different kind of color palette, the same color palette, but swapped around for the content that you make. But if it’s related to number five, you’ll still see a little five somewhere. But that’s also a part of what we’re doing, or you are doing, we are making this podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it’s gaining a bit of popularity or interest or whatever that might be. And then you are gonna be making content over there. One of the, one of the things that you wrote is you wanna, look at the SEO of this website as well,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; maybe it’s a possibility. it might just be interesting as I do this for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never do it for myself, ever. it might be worth looking at what people are searching on. On this just to see what keywords and whether we are reflecting any of that, the, obviously the keywords that match what we’re doing anyway. Yeah. There is a kind of audience in mind. it’s still the people who’ve gone down the same path that we have with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it isn’t, for people like me who are effectively at the moment. I’ve stopped using WordPress because that’s not a guaranteed at all. And there’s just some projects where you might want to do that. And of course a lot might this. This will be the first site I’ve ever done that hasn’t involved WordPress and it probably still will later, So there is a sort of price. Yeah. ’cause we still might want to put the content in a format that. Be better suited to that. So it’s quite an interesting little niche in a way that we’ve not explored or found a way of being able to communicate that. also, I think also the whole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:56] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; reliance on the WordPress plugin ecosystem for SEO, there are fabulous products out there that you can buy that really do a lot of the heavy lifting for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’ll be a bit of learning there. So how to implement it without just filling out a, field in a CMS and clicking save. making sure that each page is done correctly and that you know that all of the bits and pieces that you need. Boy, that’s a whole, that’s a whole industry of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:24] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and that’s the interesting learning bit, which I’ll do on another video about that. Just some of the main things that. When you switch from doing static traveling, a dynamic platform, there’s some advantages that you get for static with some control, and there’s some things you lose as well because the platform’s done it for you and you have to now do it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it’s the topic. But yeah, I mean I think, yeah, that’s, there’s not much we need to do it, I think other than maybe we need to write off some text and have a better designed homepage. To attract and explain the different types of content that we’re putting out, which will change. Should you have a quick look at our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:34:59] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; homepage, just very briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. So this is what it looks like at the moment. a show. For people who build websites. We’ve got a fairly, fairly dark black background. I’ve got a little bit of a menu at the top, which is, fairly self-evident. We’ve got the show strap line, which you mentioned, probably need a tweak, little bit of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re putting the latest episode on the top and I notice this fabulous new, New way of playing the episodes. I’ve gotta say, this looks pretty cool. I like this a lot. And then that’s it more or less. Then we’re onto YouTube channel, and then a tiny bit of information about who the pair of us are. Yeah, it’s very, bare bones at the minute, and obviously each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is more or less the same. We’re on, we’re looking at the stuffer episode seven at the moment. And maybe that’ll need to be tweaked as well, how each episode looks. Yeah. yeah. Okay. And that, homepage does nothing to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; explain who we are and why we’re doing this and what we’re specialized in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t even actually, right that homepage, it actually takes you to the audio podcast. And I would imagine we probably need to swap that player out to. YouTube where we seem to be on more with the option to go to your own podcast player of choice, So I imagine a reader Yeah, that’s an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, encouraging people from that page. I think YouTube, the embedded video, ’cause the audio is obviously just the same, more or less. The, idea of just having a link, should, you wish, have you, you’ve landed here. Here’s a video, and if you’ve enjoyed the content that the video has presented, how about taking that a step further and adding it to your podcast player, a choice that might be a, so instead of playing it as audio, you just the option to find the RSS feed and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be a good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; idea as well. Yeah, it could be, and it probably, we didn’t start it. I did the little videos where I’m talking about more the code stuff that. Which is roughly in line with what we’re talking about on the podcast more generally. there is one other thing that needs to be done that I think what will help us reach our goals to make this more community, and it’s what you are very skilled in, is the idea of interviewing some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; which, Which will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; probably come to the show at some point, I think. Yep. Yeah, that’s definitely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; an area that I’ve definitely clocked up some hours in doing that. Yes. and okay. Yeah, maybe be interesting because my, intuitions will be, I’ll have to hone those a lot more about the kind of questions that I ask, because I was immersed in WordPress prior to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beginning that podcast, I had a, set of a repertoire of questions, which I knew would land okay. But in this era, sorry, in this arena that, that won’t be the case. And I’ll, probably feel the, heavy burden of asking silly questions to intelligent people. So I’ll have, there’s gonna have to be a bit of, upskilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So related to the website though, putting out video content on the website. All right. So we did our best to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:57] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; answer our three questions. I think we did. I think so. But I think, and it just leads us onto a redesign, certainly of the homepage. I suspect as we go on through this, we, there’ll be only so much design that we can do on this particular site and it’ll probably need to be fairly simple always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it, there’s nothing to stop us doing a whole talk about how we might design and we can build that separately within the website with a whole different styling, another type of website so we can. I think we can explore that with different designs so we don’t have to pin everything on the look of this one site I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:31] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s good because, having, different opportunities is, yeah. Is really good. I think it’s great for now, it got us over the hump of having nothing. You put in a, enough time to make it work. So thank you Bravo for doing that. And, it got us started and in fact, in many ways, having a website right at the beginning, which was bare bones, is a fabulous starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’cause it shows that you can, you have the capacity to iterate and improve, which I guess is part of the point of today’s episode, getting the client to, to. Pay you some money with the process of getting a website iterated on over many months and years, hopefully, are we gonna do this client brief thing right at the end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you wanna do that? we’ve done it. We started with it. I think so in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:11] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; a way we’ve just covered, do we ask these questions of people? And I think we’ve, I think we’ve already covered it. Yes. Do we challenge the answers we get? We have a little bit, we just didn’t ask people these questions, did we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, For such a long time. And I think this very short article is right. I’m sure lots of people through their proper design systems do it. But for people like you and I, who were largely working locally to local customers would bypass this bit. We would you, you want a website? We can build you a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s where we’d start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:39:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s interesting. I think there’s a human component in here in that if you are a very good communicator or just very good at conversation, this. Episode, the content in this episode will probably be fairly straightforward with a bit of thought. You’ll be able to walk into that, strange environment and ask that new client that you’ve never met before, those questions, and be able to have that conversation be because you’re good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a bit more insular or a bit more of an introvert, I feel that, this is always gonna be harder. getting, just getting into the office might be hard enough. Having that conversation in a way that you’re not. Constantly thinking, let me get outta here. Let me get outta here. yeah, I, just think that’s a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we can’t teach you that, I’m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:40:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, And I think we’re coming to the end and I actually missed over, missed out something that I put at the very beginning, which I think, this is my own personal opinion, but I think the industry has very much moved to accepting the idea of those emphasizing as web designers, those soft skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being able to, help people to articulate what they want to achieve is part of Yeah. The skills that we do. And it puts us so ahead of anything that AI can do for us. This ability as humans to understand context and communicate well. And I think also this move. I think, the majority of proper, serious web design projects now have gone an agile approach where we assume that everything is gonna evolve the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we keep it as simple as possible and we iterate as we go because communication and technology changes. So I think, that’s. The way that the industry’s going. And in some ways this, these three questions here, or starting with that is very much in line with that. And, I think where web designers are increasingly going to, talk much more about this kind of communication, what we’re trying to achieve, to do, keeping it as simple as possible and iterating and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the fact that we’re in websites evolve and people evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:41:44] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve just had another thought about the, the website itself. And one of the things that I probably would want to add in, and I dunno how we’re gonna achieve this without a CMS, is, is some kind of commenting system. Because at this point in the podcast, what I want to say is, if anything you, you found in this podcast is of interest to you, or if you’ve got any, anything that you wanna add, head to the website and drop us in a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno, maybe that’s, on the five year plan. but we don’t have a commenting system. But if you’re interested, nevertheless, head over to no script show. Forward slash seven in this case. we’ve obviously got other episodes. Put a different number in there and see what pops out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, but yeah, head over to the website over there. We’ve got a YouTube channel as well. I actually don’t know what the YouTube channel URL is. Is it as simple as I. youtube.com/no script or have we managed to bag any of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:42:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; that yet? I believe it is. It will take you there on the link, but that’s the commenting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will be an interesting thing. We’ll have to do this one privately, I think. But in terms of what we need to do we need to gear people to comment through YouTube? It would help us. It would help our reach with this. Yeah. That might be. Rather than, ’cause it’s always a difficult thing, even when you’ve got WordPress, whether you turn the comments on or Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have turned them off because it’s something to have to guard against or some stuff might not reflect what you want to get over on your pages. So yeah. Okay. Yeah, we’ll add that into the list. Yeah. So we, but it’s. Something will still carry on talking about what we need to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me it is just the messaging on the beginning that it needs to explain what’s here. ’cause it doesn’t do that. as we’re saying, we’re not even sure about where we point people to. And probably YouTube is the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:43:30] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Okay. do you think that’s a wrap episode seven in the bag? It definitely is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. If that’s the case, I will get rid of the website and, all we have to say at this point is, thank you for listening. Really appreciate it. Head over to YouTube and give us a comment there. Find us on YouTube, and subscribe, all of that nonsense. But yeah, thank you. That was a really interesting episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you got something out of it. I certainly did. Thanks David. Yeah, thanks a lot. I’ll see you next time. See you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What&#39;s the big deal with container queries?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/6/" />
    <updated>2024-03-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/6/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-notes&quot;&gt;Show Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-css-container-queries&quot;&gt;What are CSS container queries?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As as soon as we got media queries this was requested, but previously it was considered technologically impossible. Miriam Suzanne&#39;s 2023 CSS Day talk is best for understanding the technical problems that browsers had to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to apply styles to elements based on the size of that element&#39;s container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An alternative to media queries, which can only style elements based on viewport size (or other device characteristics).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s part of the W3C&#39;s CSS Containment Module which describes the contain property and its units: cqw, cqh, cqi, cqb, cqmin, cqmax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also an evolving spec for CSS Container Style Queries (ie. styling elements based on the container&#39;s styles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser support is 91% (March 2024). Container Style Queries is only partially supported behind a flag in Chrome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-with-container-queries&quot;&gt;What can we do with container queries?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it is for making reusable components that can adapt to the space in the design it is given. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/patterns/layout/container-query-card&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;callout&amp;quot; card&lt;/a&gt; with an image, title, text and a button. With CQ we could be set up so it is differently arranged depending on whether it is added to a wide body area or a slim sidebar. Where slim the image might stack vertically. Where wide the image might align to one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A similar example is a weather widget showing the outlook for every day in the week. You would probably want the days horizontal if the widget has the space and vertical if not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another might be a button with text and an icon which can reduce to only an icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s possible to apply CQ to SVG&#39;s styles. It could alter icons sets or perhaps allow logos to change from rectangle to square depending on where it is placed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It offers a lot of control over complex layouts like news or magazine sites with side bars and different size callout cards. Michelle Barker created &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/getting-started-with-css-container-queries/&quot;&gt;a fabulous article&lt;/a&gt; on the MDN web doc site on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power of container queries might be realised in combining it with other new CSS spec like :has () - often called the parent selector - and subgrid. This is all new so experimentation has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-needs-container-queries-the-most&quot;&gt;Who needs container queries the most?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet to be seen. What we have so far means we probably have to re-evaluate our approach and it&#39;s also an evolving spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who may need to reflect the most might be those who:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with component based design systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make page builders and CSS frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If container styles appear AND is what we think it is, this could be the route to all theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us mostly doing the freehand styling of HTML documents may treat it as something to add as needed (or when someone adds a cool demo to CodePen!). One reason for some not using them is we still need @media for responsive images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell from Every Layout.dev say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So what layout problem do container queries solve? The simple answer is: any for which an intrinsically sound layout cannot be easily devised.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:05] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to the No Script show about modern frontend web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal dependencies and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re talking about CSS container queries. These mark a serious advancement in what browsers will allow us to do, but we are asking what does that mean for us right now? And in order to have that conversation, as always, I’m joined by David Waumsley. How you doing, David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:31] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m very good. Yeah. You are back telling me how unfit you are feeling, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, indeed. I’m, I’m no longer the young sprightly chap I once was, but, anyway, that’s our propo of nothing. Let’s, let’s get on with the show today. CSS container queries, it’s all the rage as always. David puts together the show notes and I come along for the ride. I’m learning an awful lot as we’re producing these shows, and today was no exception because I genuinely didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far the browsers had come. So shall I just pop the screen up? Yeah, absolutely. And take it from there. I’ll just quickly say that everything we’re about to show on the screen is available on our website, so if there’s any points where you are listening to this or watching it on YouTube and you want to know what’s going on, the easiest way to find that is to go to the URL as we’re on show number six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dead easy. No script show slash six, and that will be the same for every episode. Number six, number seven, number eight, or whatever it may be. So here we are. What’s, yeah, what’s the big deal with container queries? Tell us, David. Yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:01:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s allowed us, this, we must talk about the leading expert on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the person to really get your information from is Miriam Suzanne, who’s one of the invited, experts on the CSS working group for this. And she’s done a lot of content and a lot of talks. So there are some links, actually the bottom of our show notes, which are two that I think are worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the, it’s a kind of big deal because it’s allowed. Browsers to do something that they, that was considered impossible before because of the nature of browsers. The normal flow, which makes everything responsive by default, could be broken by, querying the container size as opposed to what we’ve had up to this point, which has been just media queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we need it to. You be responsive and we need things to display differently in our sizes than we use media queries. Now we’ve got this opportunity, haven’t we? To effectively, we could swap everything to container queries now, right? So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:48] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Am I right in saying that if you were to adopt container queries in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most part, you can get rid of media queries. There may be some edge cases where one still might be the best, case, but in most cases, the i the endeavor from now 2024 onwards is to move away from, querying the viewport, the, you know, what I’m talking about? Yes, And move it all over to, container query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So encapsulating little sections instead of the whole view port. I would say that we’re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:03:21] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; probably not moving to them. We could, but I would say that we’re moving much more to this intrinsic thing where, yeah, there’s a lot more flexibility with the units that we’ve got to, not even need to rely on the media queries, but weR#8217;ve got container queries, which according, you watched it as well, the good talk that does, which is containers, what do they know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s on the. 2023 CSS day. Anyway, there’s a link on our show notes to that, and she goes into the history about, really, since we got at media queries and we started to go responsive, people were instantly asking for a way to be able to. Change the styles based on the container, and it was considered impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would create loops within loops. And then there was, and she goes through the history of how that breakthrough came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:14] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; could you just pause there for a minute because I thought that whole bit about it breaking. Like more or less everything on the internet. This, container query the loops in particular, do you have a full grasp of why that was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this feels like the kind of thing, container queries, it feels like the kind of thing that people have been clamoring for, a decade or more. But the way that everything’s been built so far, there was this genuine concern that if container queries were implemented, then there’d be this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole loop of things, which would essentially be recursive and never ending, and it would break almost every website that exists. I don’t really understand why that is, but that was a big concern. The browser manufacturers are saying, no, we can’t do this. It cannot be done. I. But now it seems to have been figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:05:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I’ve only got Miriam’s explanation on it. The breakthrough came, they always thought it was impossible because of normal flow. So inline stuff just, goes downwards in the page of the, does the narrow, I. Viewport and it moves down and the idea of containing things in there would break stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It take it outta the loop or cont have loops within loops. And somebody just came up with the fact that we actually can contain the inline size of something and then that kind of opened, it broke the ceiling on this and I really don’t understand the technicals of it. But, but we’ve got it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we just explain what it, What it is exactly. Yeah. Yes, please. Yeah, go for it. Yeah. there’s some, I’m just gonna read out actually the things that are in the show notes. So it is, a way of being able to apply styles to elements based on the size of that elements container rather than the view port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an alternative to media queries, which can only style the elements based on the viewpoint width, which I’ve said it’s a part of the W three CS containment module. Which describes contain properties and its units. So we get a whole bunch of units for sizing things, right? So we get CQW for width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get CQH for height. We get CQI for inline cq B for block. we get CQ min and CQ max for min max, size with things. So we get a whole new bunch of units that come with this. The interesting thing I think about it is it’s an evolving spec at the moment because, and although this is only behind, as we record this, a flag in Chrome, there is container style queries, which are due to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is, and this opens up a lot, the ability to style elements based on the containers styles. So this could be a big deal for. Theme in the future, I think. Okay. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve just put in there that at the moment, 91% as of March, 2024 of browsers have support for this. I didn’t really in look into that in depth, but I’m guessing that 91% encapsulates most of the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers that most of the people that are using, so Chrome, Firefox, et cetera, edge, so that nine per missing percent is, fairly redundant. I know that it’s 9%, which is actually quite a lot, but, have you got an, intuition that. Broadly speaking, you can move over to this without worrying too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean it’s, I think you can, I think people are, if you don’t need to support ie. And, most of the new stuff that we’ve got, it isn’t supported by IE. And it’s gonna die up fairly soon. I think some of the issues might be with, safari, on. Some of those can’t be updated because they’re dependent on the, operating system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you need to support some people going back on older iPhones or stuff, that might be a bit of an issue. Okay. but yeah, we should talk about the next thing, really, where we can, what we can do with these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:08:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. C can I ask, before we do that, can I just smuggle in a question which will lead directly onto this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it’s not even a question, it’s just a description. Of how it’s different. So in the old world where we were using media queries, the only option that we had available to us was the width of the entire viewport. So yes, broadly speaking, the width of the browser. if it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1000 pixels and it dropped down to 900. Somewhere in between that, let’s say 950 or something, you could put a media query and you could change the styling, but it’s based on that one feature, the width of the, window, for want of a better word, the viewpoint at that exact moment. This opens up. More or less identical functionality, but on a individual part within that viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it could be, I don’t know, a card over here and another card next to it and an image, what have you, a paragraph, anything. So we can, be more refined. We can, instead of just worrying about the whole thing, we can be more refined and adapt things, make them hide, show change, font size, and what have you, based upon the width of that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the main viewpoint, and that’s the point of it, right? Just it’s more granular. It gives us a more. Publisher, Think magazine option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. A absolutely. it does lead to something else. people are very used to using container as the name for something that will mark up in the HTML two style than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have to think a little bit about that because Container now has become its own spec, if you like, I think people all often used to call wrappers or containers is what we often use to contain something where. treating that with media queries or just normal flow where It’s one extra element. We might need to change our name in a little bit. Now we have container queries where container means something else now, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and, I guess it’s important to point out at this point that container is the really the right word, because you are. You are using the children of a container to go back up the dome and look at something outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you know, it might be a paragraph, but you’re asking the paragraph to look at its container to figure out what it should be. So it’s asking questions of its parents, if you like. Yeah. And presumably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; it can make any element you want the container for the thing that you are styling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So you could go, you could really get granular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could, it could, it could go all the way down, couldn’t it? Okay, great. Yeah. Sorry, I’ve interrupted. Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:56] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, and in some ways the examples, and you’ll probably bring some up on here, of how people are using, it’s the, standard example, I think we’ve even talked about this before, is the kind of call out card and the MDM records actually has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can pull that up. Yeah. So let me just make&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:12] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; sure on the screen if I got the right one. Is it this one you wanted to show at this point or was it the other one? I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:17] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; think it’s the other one I think. Yes. Okay. That one. Yes, that’s it. okay, there is on the, yeah, nd n records there, the documents there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nice example which folks are watching this will be able to see where, this is the card example where you. this is where we’re still carrying on with components because now we can change the inline size of a container. We can make the content in that respond to the size that’s available to that container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we’re seeing on the screen here is a card that when it’s got the room, we may have the image over to one side and a title to the right off that with some. Copy and maybe a button. But if that container then needs to move into a sidebar with less space or another design entirely where it has less space, then it will adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is adapting where it’s got smaller space. So the image is going on the top on this example, the. Main body text has disappeared. ’cause there isn’t the space, it’s just leaving the title and the button. And I think that’s probably the, did I explain that well? I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I guess if you’re listening to this and there’s no audio, it’s exactly as David said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the, yeah, the fact that the text disappears, it’s probably the key thing here, isn’t it? In that we’re quite used to seeing something like this, image left. Title, right body, right bottom below, all of that. That’s a fairly common layout. And then as it collapses before the, whole layout changes to be entirely vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the intuition is now the text is just occupying too much space. We, want the image to be occupying the full height of the card. So now the text has taken up too much room. So let’s just. Get rid of the text so that the bottom doesn’t look like it’s floating in its own space. And, it’s fairly, it’s a fairly simple demonstration, but it works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll, put the links into the show notes. Yeah. But this is, yeah. And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. And then a couple of similar examples with the same idea is a weather widget where you might have the days of the week where you’re saying it’s suddenly on these. Days and that if you’ve got the space for it, then you’re going to show these horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it needs to go in a sidebar, it, you would have to create for that sidebar before we got container queries, a whole new setup. But here you can take one style at once and say, make it behave like this if it’s in a smaller space, and then it may stack horizontally or lose some of the stuff. And we’ve seen that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s used, on some designs where we may have a button. that will have text and an icon and then when it’s got less space, it’s just got the text. And when it’s got even less space, it’s just got the icon. So we could build those in with a container query rather than a media query and have that place wherever we like in our design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s this idea of this modularity where we can Bring these things into different designs and create our components out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:09] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I guess, the example that’s on the screen, and again, apologies to those people listening. You can imagine that being repeated, I don’t know, in a three by three grid or something, where you’ve got three of these similar cards next to each other, but then of course on a news website, you may want a more or less identical card to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some attributes on the page. You, for example, you may wanna keep the body text, because it’s the headline, it’s the most important thing on the page. So at the beginning, it looks like everything else, but as you collapse it, it doesn’t lose the same features. And because it’s a container query rather than a view port query, it can behave in its own unique way, than all the other ones in the main grid, if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first item could behave differently to the second, third, and fourth and, so on. yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:55] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; And you’ve got tab as well for another example, which again is on MD ed by, wonderful Michelle Barker, who’s created a good explanation of this. And I don’t know if, for those who can see it, that makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the big deal is if you’ve got a news site where maybe previously you would have certain news in a sidebar, and if you were using the view port widths, then you would need to treat that sidebar. Would have to move as you lost space, right? But here, what we can do within the sidebar, we can put those in containers and have them independently changed to the content that might be in the main section area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a new site, it gives you so many different ways that you could treat those individual cards. they could be changing within the sidebar based on the container, not the view port, and also the main content area Could be styling some of those cards independently of that, and I think that’s the big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:52] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s a pretty profound design actually. I really like it. the styling is incredibly basic just to illustrate what’s going on. But again. The links will be in the show notes, but what you’re seeing is a little bit what I just like what I just described, where you’ve got this main headline article, which when it’s in, let’s call it desktop, we’re gonna have to stop using those, terms, aren’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where, when it’s in the, widest possible view, you’ve got one article. Occupying like the headline space, and then beneath it, there’s two more, and then beneath that, there’s four more. And as it collapses, it goes to one main and then two. But the orientation of the ones underneath it change. And then obviously as you collapse it to what we might describe as a mobile view, everything stacks and looks identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the only difference is that ones are higher up on the page, but the styling is identical for all of them. So it really offers you an opportunity to make. For those people who’ve got the space on their screen to make things stand out. And then where you don’t have the space just to make things look more or less like a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s really nice and very profound. yeah. Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:54] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I think with a news like that, if I had a sidebar, which isn’t really showing on the example we’re looking at on the screen here, but it, I would imagine that if I wanted to keep the sidebar fixed quite small and compared two. The main content as it gets smaller, I might just turn these into links and get rid of all of the images independently in the sidebar, allowing more space in the main content area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you couldn’t do that independently before, so it does allow for that. But I know again. It’s little&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:23] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; intuitions like that, isn’t it? The more that, you explore this and the more that you think about this, the more that these things occur to you. You know what to do with the sidebar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I could try that now. As opposed to in the past it was just, that’s not possible. Okay. shall I take that off the screen or is there some, something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, take it off the, we can go back to notes. There was one more thing actually that I thought was a very cool example of what you could do with it, and that is because you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SVGs, it’s part of standards as well. Oh, we could make that a container and play, apply some of the sizes, styles to that. So in the example of a logo, it would be possible where you need that to be a rectangular logo laid out in a certain way. Have it when you’ve got that space, do that and then have it go to what a, a square with some of the elements in that logo changing or arranging themselves differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the space available. And I think that’s quite cool because you might, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:17] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; just, to pick that apart, because an SVG is, a document basically. So it is got, it’s got, the component parts. It’s not just a flat image of, it’s, just data and the browser passes it and figures out how to display that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, it’s a document, so it’s made up of little bits. And because of that, you can query those little bits. And a perfect example, you just said you’re on a desktop, you’ve got a main navigation at the top, and you want a flat, rectangular letterbox style logo. But as you collapse it, it might be better to just have a centralized square logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so you can do that on an SVG level. So you modify the actual. Image. It’s not like you’re swapping one image for a different one. You are actually modifying it. You can imagine people getting really granular with that so that as the browser is collapsed incrementally, the logo kind of morphs and moves around and little parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagine you’ve got a logo with three circles and they’re in a triangle at the beginning, and you want ’em to all be in, in a horizontal line. You can imagine them being pulled out slowly, like an animation you might see. Yeah, that’s fun. That’s a really interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:29] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I thought, I’ve not seen, only a very basic example of that on Code Pen, but I think, yeah, something to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might take a lot of time, but the idea of this portable logo that will display the way you want it to display wherever it goes. Just, but you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:42] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; imagine tools like Illustrator taking that work on for you. You can’t, you where you get an option to have it. Have it, in this orientation and even have that, the animation bit taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if it’s this width, we want that one to eventually end up over there. And the, software will figure out the percentages that it’s got to work through to get it to, to get to that point in the correct amount of time. Anyway, I’m totally off piece now. I’m, but, fascinating. Fascinating. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we get excited about it. Should we&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:10] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; pull some cold water overall? Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite, the interesting thing for me, I think, I mean I’ll put that in the show notes, you may disagree. I think the people who are gonna be most interested in this or need to be thinking about it is the people who are doing component based, design systems, which I don’t think I’ll be investing that time in that particularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are looking that way, particularly with the idea of style queries, and theme that might go on. So I think those people who are building those systems. We’ll probably start to need to think about these things. And also maybe page builders or CSS frameworks, they might change their na. Then probably need to start thinking about how they might be able to use this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I think it is a bit of a, I hate to use the word game changer, Oh, I, actually think the interesting thing is from my own personals. Perspective. I don’t know if I would invest that much time in this. I think I, and I put their little quote in it. It’s behind, a paywall. this is Hayden Picker and Andy Bell from every layout dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I saw that quote and I think it sums up where I’ve gone with this. So they say, What layout problems do container query solve? This simple answer is any for which an intrinsically sound layout cannot easily be devised. I misread that, but same point and I thought, yeah, that’s where I’ve gone. To be honest, there’s been so much stuff in CSS that so many ways that we can not have to rely on query and stuff that we can build in flexibility with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic methods that I would put all my efforts into that before I moved into some of this clever stuff that we can do with container queries. So that’s where I found myself with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:22:11] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I can imagine that. we, so we were looking, before we hit record at a variety of UK news website. So we looked at the BBC and the Guardian, and they, although my intuition, or your intuition I think was that they’re probably not using, this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the moment they’re probably using, the viewport and media queries and what have you. You can really see how this stuff would map well, but it would require quite a lot of backend CSS engineering, in order to make it work. But once you’ve set that up, then it’ll work beautifully on absolutely every device, and it’ll take away a lot of headaches and everything will be really straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there will be. A lot of work to get that working. Yes. And the websites that you are building, maybe the client doesn’t have the budget for that. Maybe the client just doesn’t have that much content. It’s gonna be a much more, header, hero image and then a main section. And, and it doesn’t really fit into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is collapse the text and collapse the content. So it might be a bit of overkill, but we’re after a, sorry, You go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:23:19] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, no, I, was just gonna say, Suzanne is almost the perfect person to describe what happens, so you can invest a lot of time on the perfect system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She created a framework called Susie, of which of course, she says today, please don’t use my framework. Use the modern CSS. So we’ve always got that, and it’s how much you’re going to invest to save some time on your future projects against when that might need to change because you’ve. Saddled yourself to some kind of framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most of the time I’m styling documents, mostly text, and I can get with intrinsic methods. So I can see how this is more important than probably a, although I got excited and thought I must need to know this inside out, I’ve realized that I need to know a lot more about CSS inside out and how I can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think things like every layout, which is a way of simplifying as best as you can, using the less CSS to give your responsive. You meet your responsive needs. Using the least possible is the kind of approach that I’ve decided to go with this. There is one interesting thing, and I dunno if I actually put it on the show notes I should have done, but there was an interesting tweet, that was going out on X and it was by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kravitz. Okay. She’s a Google person who talks a lot on CSS, really clever person. She was asking, when are people using, are you using container queries? And I’ve not even thought about this before, but a couple of people replied, no, because we can’t, we haven’t got responsive images for it. They are still based, oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the media queries and I thought, I’ve not even thought about that. And I thought, yes, it is a bit of a holdup on the moment for that. Okay. Yeah, that is a bit of a holdup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:24:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s interesting. Yeah. I do think the page builder crowd, you can well imagine that there must be quite a lot of talk and excitement in that space about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know quite how you would, in a visual way describe all of the different ways it’s gonna. collapse when the view port collapses. ’cause obviously each little part will be different or how they’d set that, that up in the ui. But their page builders are always looking for the next interesting thing, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set themselves apart from their competitors and to also just make it so that you can have everything done in a u, in a. Gooey, it does feel like this is a good place for them to go. yes, we’re both from the WordPress space, so we understand, the limitations of some of those different technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ha, having, describing how that works will be interesting. rather than having a, a static image to show what that layout will look like. You might need something like, I don’t know, an animated, web P image or something like that to show how it will collapse, but I think that’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that’ll be an area for growth in the future. Throw in grid. Yeah, throw in all of this and it’ll be really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:07] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; I absolutely, I think, if theming comes with that, with the styles and being able to size things where somebody can grab and that’s, things like WordPress are very much about building these reusable patterns and the idea that you can just sling them where you like and it’ll adapt is a, real plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, yeah, that I. That’s really, I think, all we can say on this. Yeah. Yeah. It’s a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; fascinating new technology and it’s in a browser, probably that you are using at the moment, so you can start exploring it. The links, as I said, will be in the show notes. It sounds David, as if you might be throwing Uma’s link in, to add it to the ones that we’ve got at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all the videos that we described and all of the different things that we raised on the screen. I’ll be on the, the website, no script show. Yeah. And in this case slash number six. So yeah, I think we’ve done it. That was a, nice brief one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:26:59] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Next time I think we’ll be talking, it’s about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re gonna, I think, break from what we intended to do, which was to cover all the new features in CSS and HTML. But I think we need to have a break so we can talk about how we’re going to design this website that’s already out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:15] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Which needs, who you wanted to do a good deal of TLC? Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we keep forgetting to mention that the website is gonna be, under David’s purview ’cause he’s far more clever than I am. And, as we go through subjects, David’s gonna try and implement something of that. Into the website. So we haven’t covered a great deal that can be implemented thus far, but that’ll come and hopefully, in the year 2029, the website will look absolutely fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley:&lt;/strong&gt; So I think next time we’re gonna be talking about, how do we start a web project? I know we’ve already started this one, but that’s what, we’ll discuss the next one. So I hope people will join us for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:53] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley:&lt;/strong&gt; Great. we’re done. We’ve wrapped up episode six. We will see you on episode seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, David. Nice chatting to you again. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is component based web design?</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/5/" />
    <updated>2024-02-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/5/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;show-notes&quot;&gt;Show Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhen in the 2010&#39;s the people on the web had a shared epiphany. Building websites was no longer about our ability to style HTML documents (to show off in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://csszengarden.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about our ability to identify and create reusable blocks of UI to build (brick by brick) our websites. When we say sites we mean apps. Sites were just so 2009!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-mean-by-component-based-web-design&quot;&gt;What do we mean by component based web design?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are simplifying, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shift from styled pages to design systems of reusable UI building blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impact of Atomic Design by Brad Frost and Facebook&#39;s React in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different type of &amp;quot;separation of concerns&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrap, Google Material design, Page Builders and Gutenberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In CSS the BEM (Block Element Modifier) component approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Frost&#39;s 2023 talk called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK_PICNTgAg&quot;&gt;Is Atomic Design dead?&lt;/a&gt; gives a good historical account (from a design systems point of view) of the fast change of tools, approaches and terminology over this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://noscript.show/images/atomic-design.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram of Atomic design.&quot;&gt; Borrowed from Brad Frost&#39;s Atomic Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-we-need-component-based-web-design&quot;&gt;Do we need component based web design?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;don&#39;t repeat yourself&amp;quot; (DRY) principle behind component based design is sound. Even better, you can steal from others. But it has not been without issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scores of complex design systems. Not very agile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many JS frameworks reinventing the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A division between frontend devs and with the web platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overkill of cool, but user unfriendly widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS Burnout and extra mark-up for CSS (BEM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendulum swings, but ultimately we have to decide ourselves based on the type of work we do. The human tendency is to follow the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-our-component-options&quot;&gt;What are our component options?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React JS a decade ago allowed for CSS encapsulated components, but it was a 3rd party framework dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to purely stick with web standards (that will last for as long as we have browsers) we have recently been given some new options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(HTML) Web Components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container Queries (combined with the :has() selector and subgrid).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Assembly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;html-web-components&quot;&gt;(HTML) Web components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll talk about Container Queries in the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Elements (Light DOM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadow DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declarative Shadow DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declarative Custom Elements - specification not ready yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@scope is here to CSS which allows for allows for modular CSS.We hate to say it, but it could be a game changer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Transcript&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:06] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Welcome to the No Script web show about modern frontend web design, where we look at what we can build today with minimal dependencies and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we&#39;re asking ourselves, what is component-based web design? Do we need it? And if we do, how do we get it? My name&#39;s Nathan Wrigley, and I&#39;m joined as always. David Waumsley. How are you doing, David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:28] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, you pointed in the right direction. Yeah, I&#39;m good, and you are not so good. You&#39;re a little bit deaf in one ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:34] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: I&#39;m definitely a little bit deaf in one ear. I&#39;ve had a, I&#39;ve had a bout of poorliness, but thankfully I&#39;m out the other side and raring to get into the topic of component based web design. As always, you&#39;ve put the show notes up, I dunno if you want me to share them on the screen right at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:50] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: I think so, so you&#39;ve broken it up in the beginning with the three things. Here&#39;s, the difficulty with components. We say components and it means so many different things to so many different people in different contexts. So we&#39;re gonna have to oversimplify what we&#39;re talking about here and and we have, we&#39;ve done it with a few bullet points. If you scroll down for those YouTube watchers, we&#39;re really referring to this kind of idea that seemed to arrive, I think somewhere in the 2010s. Particularly about, 2013 when we got atomic design, a really influential, book by Brad Foster and also within the same month, we got Facebook&#39;s React coming out, which allowed us to do things that we couldn&#39;t do before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seemed that we were moving to this idea, this epiphany that everybody seemed to share. And that&#39;s my experience as well with it, where you suddenly thought. Websites are like these apps with these reusable UI bits components that we build up how to blocks, and we really should do a lot more that shouldn&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a sensible way to build instead of doing things the way that we used to do before where we were styling these documents. Independently. So whatever the HTML you marked up on the content, then you just went about and styled it. What if we just created these little blocks and put them all together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll save loads of time and stop repeating ourselves all the time with that. And j. Nathan, my experience, I feel like I went through that myself. That&#39;s because when I started with initially with HTML and CSS, it was all about. the CSSN garden and all of that. It was about styling those documents, and then by the time I got into WordPress and then page builders came in, that seemed to be all component based design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:02:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I guess the, whole page builder, and I suppose this would be true of WordPress page builders, but also SaaS based apps, it&#39;s funneling you down the idea that the whole document is made up of a bunch of individual little components, these little blocks, so I don&#39;t know, hero section or a. A little card, which has an image and some text and perhaps a button or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you style it once and then you duplicate it and that styling gets transferred over to that new one and then you duplicate it again and, maybe turn it into something global so that if you want to use that somewhere else on the website, you can just do that again and change it all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s so many things that make sense about it. Because it, it is quite nice in a project, especially, I guess if you&#39;re working with a team, which I never really did, to have that shared understanding of what it is that you are doing. So every time we create this card, it&#39;s gonna look exactly like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&#39;s all of the styling that goes with it. It&#39;s encapsulated in that one thing. it&#39;s not the same as this other hero section, it&#39;s just for that card. it definitely makes sense and yeah, you&#39;re right. Page builders encouraged that way of thinking. For a long time. It made perfect sense to me. But you are, I think you are moving away from that a little bit now. Back to the, air quotes, the old way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:04:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: of doing things. the old ways of coming back, I think to a certain degree, at least where we thought we were, was challenged before. And that&#39;s my experience, the page builder side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, it made perfect sense, Brad. frost whole atomic design at the time, and it. Things that we know, bootstrap, Google Material Design, all of these kind of things came outta this idea. Of course that makes sense. And it made sense to me. And I think in the page builder tradition of doing stuff, I realized that, all I wanted when I got into page builders was more modules, gimme more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More bricks I can put into my designs. and then it turned over time without knowing any of these debates, just through practice itself where I came back to the fact, actually most of the time for most of the work I do, it&#39;s about getting this message over, which is mostly text with a few images to and I need to style those and arrange them in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually, I. I didn&#39;t need a slider. I didn&#39;t need a little block for frequently asked questions that were dropping down just for one line or something like that. We didn&#39;t need to create all those things. So I shifted without knowing these debates. But now having looked, and I know you looked at, Brad Foss, talk, which is a recent one where is. Is atomic design dead? And that&#39;s something I obviously, in our show notes, there is a link to that and it&#39;s worth watching &#39;cause it gives such a sort of whirlwind, hi historical account of how the technology for designing webpages from a designer&#39;s point of view, rather than a coder&#39;s point of view, doesn&#39;t he? And how we&#39;ve changed to all these. Different kind of tools over the time and different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:06:07] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: really interesting being Brad Frost though, because obviously you were leading this charge of this component based, or as he calls it, atomic. Yeah, and it&#39;s definitely served his purposes quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s become a sort of minor celebrity in the web design world and it, and, but this talk in 2023 is a decade after he launched this idea and gained a lot of success out of it. and I think his. I think his position is that, it still has utility. He didn&#39;t seem to be saying, look, abandon a abandon ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no hope here. but it is interesting going back because I&#39;d forgotten a lot of the components that made up his atomic design. And, broadly, if you are looking at the YouTube video of this, then you can see it on the screen. But if you are not, he Encapsulates the, idea of atomic design is, that everything is made of atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the sort of smallest part is an atom. And then if you, gather up a bunch of. Atoms. So the smallest parts of the, dom, if you like the page that you can, then you get these molecules, and then if you gather those molecules together, so that&#39;s a slightly bigger part. And then if you gather those together, then you get an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest with you, the nomenclature, the wording at this point has lost all meaning for me. Atoms, works molecules, works organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:38]&lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Suddenly that doesn&#39;t work for me. &#39;cause it&#39;s got this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:43] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: notion of being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:44] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: alive or something. And, but it&#39;s really, he&#39;s just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:07:47] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: saying, okay, it&#39;s a bigger thing than a collection of atoms and a collection of molecules. And then it steps outside of that. Biological frame reference. And then he talks about, templates and ultimately pages. And it is, it&#39;s a neat way of encapsulating it. And when in 2013 everybody was scrambling around for a way to make design easier, and the web at that point was starting to get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rou could, you really were seeing, think of Facebook. There were bits of Facebook, which just repeated it. Itself all over the place. Yeah. you&#39;d have hundreds of this thing and hundreds of this thing. Yeah. and so I guess it made sense to start thinking about it in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe it still really does, maybe it still does work. If you&#39;re on a giant project and you&#39;ve got a hundred people working on, excuse me, one thing, and they all need to share that understanding of what that one thing looks like and what&#39;s an easy way to distill it. Make it a component, make it so that&#39;s the card, that&#39;s what the timeline view looks like, and a aspects of the timeline will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then another one will look just the same. Here&#39;s where everything is, here&#39;s the atom, here&#39;s the molecule, here&#39;s the organism, and so on and so forth. So I, guess if you&#39;re not you, David working, freelancer working by yourself, there&#39;s robably still utility in this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:09:06] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: I would&#39;ve thought. Yeah, and I think the whole thing goes with the development of the app as well, with the The mobile was fit, where there&#39;s a slightly different expectation of how an app might work as it recognizable components as opposed to the website. And really they&#39;re on a continuum in reality. And I think we&#39;ve readjust our thinking there, but it comes in with that. There was a, I wrote down a little example to make sense of the atoms and molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an atom might be a button which you would define, and then a molecule might be an input field that has a button in front of a form and an organism may be the whole footer that contains all of those things they could be in, in there. And it builds up in that way. And I think a lot of it was about working in teams to create this kind of design system, which we&#39;ve no experience of that. we&#39;re taking customers one at a time, working on our own and we really didn&#39;t need to worry too much about the naming of our button &#39;cause Yeah. It&#39;s just for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:10:18] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: But I guess if your team has complete buy-in to this, component based process, and let&#39;s say that you go with the atomic way of describing it, atom, molecule, organism, I can see a, I can see a moment where everybody&#39;s just got that hardwired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their head and they all know, okay, the here&#39;s, the atom. Like you say it might be a button and, here&#39;s the associated molecule and this is what our organic or organism footer looks like, or hero section or whatever it may be. very soon. I can imagine that just becomes embedded and people start to talk about it and it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting me into that would take. There&#39;d be a lot of onboarding, and I&#39;d have to really wrangle, my head around it because I&#39;m not using those, not using those, terms, but in effect, having used the page builder for years, I am using those terms, but I&#39;m just not giving them the same name. yes.But yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:11:16] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: so there you go. And I I think the importance of something like React at that time when you&#39;ve got atomic design and React coming out. React was this thing that solved this issue because it&#39;s a cascading style sheet. So we were used to defining the look of a page and a document at the top of, most of your rules were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were going for these individual blocks, they had to be encapsulated. And that&#39;s really what. Facebook React brought, which wasn&#39;t available. If you wanted to work in teams and you wanted to isolate your button to be a certain style, then you could make it a component through React in a way that was difficult to do if you worked in a team with CSS and those people who did still work with CSS has to come up with kind of ways of being able to modularize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS itself. And that became quite complex. So we got Bem, which is the block mod, element modifier, way of elective stuff. And I think it&#39;s fascinating because what shifted was this. What is often referred to as separation of concerns where you used to try and when we were learning h TML to CSS in the first place, I came across this term and it was about separating your HTML document from what was in your CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, made reference. From, you need to put some classes sometimes in your htm l although admittedly, the first, when I went back to html, the first site I did, I tried to avoid using any classes to see if I could keep that separation of concern. And I was able to do it with the CSSI was really, I was able to select Nth Child of things. Okay, so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:12:57] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: you did it that way, so you were Yeah. In effect using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: but yeah, they, but they were separated from the html, it wasn&#39;t in the document. So there was always that concern about keeping those things separate. And when we shifted to this, the separation of concern was keeping the. Units, the individual, the button separate from the input that was separate, and it&#39;s a complete shift. And that&#39;s obviously where we get things like Ben in CSS and we get, react and all of those libraries come out there. But I think we&#39;ll move on to the next question we asked ourselves, do we need it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:13:36] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I think I made the case just then that it definitely. I think it definitely had a moment in time where it, for the broadening scope of what the web could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;web apps and complicated web applications and, mobile phone apps and all of that kind of thing. The, I think it probably really useful and probably continues to be useful. I guess the question really relies on what kind of work it is that you are doing. do you need a component based web design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not. Would a team still need component based web design? I, can certainly see why it would be handy to have. but do you wanna go, should we go through the, the bullet points that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:22] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: you listed? Yeah, so the, sense is still there today, isn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t repeat yourself the dry method, you know that is still there, it&#39;s not without problems with going for components for, one of those is that there were just scores of complex design systems out there, which, you spend more time trying to come up with design systems and you do design in anything I think is. I think that&#39;s where Brad was quite apologetic in his atomic design about that because he knows in a lot of organizations this becomes problematic in itself, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:14:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: I wonder how many teams there are out there where, when they onboard somebody new, they have to teach them their design system, which, it might be popular throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each employee might have been using something entirely different when they arrive. And so there&#39;s that moment where they&#39;ve got to be onboarded and taught how it works and, okay, this is what we do for this is what we do for that. And maybe we lose thousands of hours each year just to that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. And I think his job was to, To try and explain how you can create your own in-house design system and people can spend more time on that. And my point on that, I think, I&#39;ve no experience of it, but it feels like it&#39;s not very agile. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can kind, you have to define how your button&#39;s going to look for this design system or how you name this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t change things as you move along with the project as real. feedback comes in from the site, so you fixed yourself early. So I think that&#39;s a problem. Oh, and then also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:15:58] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: that&#39;s interesting. Yeah. So you mean not agile in that sense? Not, it&#39;s not agile, amongst the employees, you mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not particularly agile to change, should you discover that certain things need, a complete overhaul. Okay. Alright. I&#39;d mis I&#39;d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:16:12] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: misunderstood that. Alright. I, think you just, you and in a way there&#39;s great examples of how you can. spend a lot of time creating a design system, then you make a mistake and you replicate that mistake over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of examples of that in material design it, they removed the labels for your inputs and, decided because it looks stylish and then put placeholders above. And there&#39;s a great video by Hayden Picker in, on that one what happened to inputs, but obviously they realized that this is a usability problem for people and, misusing, how HML works for their design system, but it looked cool. But because it&#39;s Google and it&#39;s their material design, lots of people jumped on it. the dry don&#39;t repeat yourself, can also end up repeating lots of mistakes which are difficult to correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you spend a long time, you&#39;re not very agile, are you? If you define how. Everybody has to work in putting something together in these blocks. You can&#39;t, as, I can just change, if I want my naming convention in my CSS to change, I can just do it. because you&#39;ve got a find a replace and it&#39;s done, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:24] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: yeah. You&#39;ve gotta notify your team and make sure that not only do the team know it, but they&#39;ve implemented it across the entire project. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;d misunderstood your point there, but I get it now. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:17:36] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: when you realize you made a mistake on all of your forms, to have to go back over that design system and get everybody on a meeting, you can&#39;t, you&#39;re just say, oh, that&#39;s a, and I&#39;ll just change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but yeah. And I think also that the. CSS in JavaScript is also those frameworks is difficult because effectively you&#39;re reinventing the browser. Most of the time you&#39;re telling the browser how to behave to do CSS. So it&#39;s, there&#39;s a lot of complexities with that and, that some of the downsides, What else did I put in here? Yeah, so you could, but obviously that leads to JavaScript burnout, which a lot of people have been experiencing as they have to, work with different frameworks which keep changing all the time, or feel they have to learn a new framework, which seems to do something a bit better than the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:28] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: yeah, it must be fairly demoralizing if you are. Literally, moving from job to job and you are moving from framework to framework and you never coincide with the same framework twice. And just to imagine the, the joy that would bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:18:45] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. Yeah. And I think, Obviously stepping out and going back to HTML myself, I very quickly worked out that I didn&#39;t want to use things like bem, which was very popular as a way of modularizing your CSS and because it just didn&#39;t have that separation and concern. Suddenly your HTML was full of so many instructions that you needed so many selectors that affected your, CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with Tailwind again, which is, Being very useful for a lot of people who&#39;ve been working with component based design who are JavaScript based developers, mostly working with that. It&#39;s quite useful for them. But if you stand back for someone like me who could you know and has managed to learn enough CSS and HDML to feel confident with sites, you realize that this is just such an overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so much extra code and no separation of concerns. So it depends who you are, but I can see there&#39;s a bit of a, shift away from the last decade where we were Yeah. Components because it didn&#39;t it make perfect sense?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:19:49] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Is there anything in your recent forays into CSS and HTML. That you have been defeated by. Is there anything that you&#39;ve wished to achieve or some sort of little stretch goal on a project where you thought that would be a nice thing to implement, where you realized that the only way to achieve that would&#39;ve been through something like a JavaScript framework, but you just said to yourself, no, forget it. We&#39;ll just, we&#39;ll pair back the design, we&#39;ll do the, more straightforward thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:20:15] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. I think you&#39;ve just led onto the next topic, actually, the last thing we were gonna cover, which is, what are our component options? Because yes, in a way, we need it for this site. but yeah, we, I listed out some things here where we now have more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once really, if you wanted this component based design. And to encapsulate something that you were reusing, and in our case, we&#39;ve needed it. We probably need a podcast player or not. We&#39;ll talk about this later. Yeah. But that&#39;s a component where we&#39;d probably want to be able to take this one component and move it to wherever you needed an audio player without having to reinvent the wheel all the time with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before, really, there wasn&#39;t much option you would&#39;ve to use something like a React library to do something like that. Where now we have got some new options, they&#39;re not new, but we have what is called web components. do you wanna explain that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:10] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: a little bit? &#39;cause I think it might be interesting for it. Maybe use the use case of the, the air, what is it? Even the MP three player? That&#39;s what I&#39;m after. The audio player. yeah, just go into that a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:21:23] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: little bit. I mean with web components, really, I mean it&#39;s just using, it&#39;s actually predates React. It goes back to, 2011. It&#39;s taken different forms and it&#39;s different APIs if you like, but essentially it is just linking your JavaScript to your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the simplest level, it is a custom element that you create. So we&#39;ve actually got a couple of them acting on the site, which I&#39;ll do videos on later. so we&#39;ve actually got the videos going through a web component. I. Which effectively is just within, I borrowed it from somebody else&#39;s library, and all it is a custom element that says, I forgot what it&#39;s called actually on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says Light YouTube embed or whatever, and we&#39;re putting that in there. And then this JavaScript created by somebody else is acting on this custom element. Stopping YouTube from loading all of its things until this, image has been clicked. And we have another one where it is, taken from Dave Rupert, which I haven&#39;t shown to anybody yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we&#39;ll do a video on this one, which is a podcast player, designed around the existing. audio tag the element itself, but add it on through JavaScript around another custom element called a podcast player. it adds to that and adds in some extra functionality through JavaScript and also the Stein in that goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what&#39;s considered as the shadow dom because. The styling isn&#39;t, so it&#39;s very portable. We can take that and move it anywhere else. So we have got that option in there. there&#39;s a lot to talk about this because it&#39;s done at the end of last year, 2000 and, 23. There were so many people, if you like, who were standard space people talking about this and whether they need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it&#39;s gained a lot of attention and for me. I don&#39;t know if I fully understand what we&#39;re talking about. &#39;cause some people talk about the shadow dom, which is a way of using JavaScript to add in to your browser, some extra slots if you like. Yeah. With functionality in it. And it allows you to encapsulate your CSS, which used to be a problem for everybody before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also has a slight issue with it in the sense that, as you saw, I was showing you the demo of the podcast player when you. Load the page. There&#39;s a, flash of un styled content that happens &#39;cause the JavaScript then has to load the, CSS. so there&#39;s a lot of people who are just looking towards the light dom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But effectively, when you&#39;re talking about light dom, all you&#39;re talking about is putting a custom element. So you create your own instead of having a diviv. Between your angle brackets, you put a name, so it could be Pod, and it has to have a dash player in between that, and you&#39;ve got your own custom element and you can attach JavaScript or CSS to it, or you can create within that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that, that&#39;s the, I think more people are moving that way. certainly when you look at, it&#39;s not the case with React at the moment, but you can, through another service, you can convert a lot of the. Libraries that are created Views library, they&#39;ve got one as well. And React Libraries, they can be converted into, web components, HTML, web components as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we, I think there&#39;s a lot of moving that way or moving both directions. So if you are a. JavaScript library person who wants to stay would react? I think you can. There&#39;s a, bit of a, getting back to standards without React, being something with JavaScript, people being off on a entirely different planet to the web standards people who put JavaScript as the third language, which you need to call upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think there&#39;s a emerging going on and I&#39;m talking too much. no. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:25:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: was just gonna say, I&#39;ll probably. Paraphrase what you&#39;ve just said in order to Encapsulate my understanding of it as well, but also to say that if you want to see this in action now, I don&#39;t know if this will be the correct url, but the show notes for this episode will be at no script show slash five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&#39;ll be an audio player there or whether it&#39;ll be this, Web component version of it is as yet to be decided. But if you, see something with, I don&#39;t know, a non-standard player, then you&#39;ll know that David has implemented it on that particular page. But is so what you&#39;re saying is this web component for, let&#39;s take the example of the audio player you, load in the.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The, audio file in the normal way the browser takes control and says, okay, I&#39;m gonna show it with the default browser, version of an audio player, which is, pretty uninteresting to look at. But in order to make that more potentially usable, to add in elements, take away elements or just style elements, you&#39;ve, there&#39;s a little bit of JavaScript which hijacks that and.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes it into a web component so you can make, I dunno, the play button be in the center rather than at the far left. You can make the, the, scrubber, the way you find where you want to go in the audio. You can stretch that across the whole element. You can add, jump 30 seconds, go back 30 seconds, you can put the speed up, play it two times and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can style it, you can make it go wherever you want, but a drawback of that. Is that the JavaScript takes a moment to load. So you get this kind of content, a cumulative layout shift problem where you get a flash of the old one, the new one comes in and it looks nice when it&#39;s done, but maybe you&#39;re storing up problems in terms of Google and SERP and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I dunno, but is that what you&#39;re saying? This is the web component that you&#39;ve played with here. You&#39;ve hijacked the audio. The default audio player and you&#39;ve just made it look different, but you can imagine that being played out across any aspect of the website. It could be the video, it could be the buttons, it could be anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:27:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I mean it&#39;s obviously, I haven&#39;t done it. It&#39;s somebody much cleverer than me, Dave Rupert, who&#39;s actually has created a podcast player for their show, which is Shop Talk. Which is, excellent. so they created that and I&#39;ve just been able to literally just take their files and do that. And it&#39;s on style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if I put the styling on, I have to take the sty in and put it in the JavaScript itself, and it&#39;s loading it through the shadow dom. But yes, it&#39;s creating all of the things that through JavaScript they&#39;ve added in, which isn&#39;t in the default audio, but if somebody turns JavaScript off, the interesting thing is that we&#39;re still putting the audio, tag within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The custom element tags that we&#39;ve got, and if I turn JavaScript off the audio. Player is still there, the default one that&#39;s in your browser and will still play if you turn off your JavaScript. So as wonderful fallback. Yeah. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:21] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: the JavaScript hijacks the already loaded audio tag and then just disrupts that and replaces it, what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. rewrites that bit of the dom, and inserts it. And you were saying that the styling in there, if you don&#39;t put any styling inside of that little, shadow dom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:28:39] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: It just, it&#39;s default styling, is it? Or, how does it look? Yeah, that&#39;s it. You have to put the, any styling you want has to be registered within the JavaScript under the shadow dom, where the light dom, which is what I&#39;m using for the videos on the learn tab, is just preventing, that&#39;s light dom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the. Effectively, it&#39;s nothing more as I understand it, other than putting this custom element that we&#39;ve put of light YouTube and connecting any JavaScript that you want to do to it. So it&#39;s no different for something I did before I even understood about web components. So I used to do that with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference is now that it&#39;s relating to a particular custom element, right? But I&#39;ve got my CSS separate to that, so it loads before, so there&#39;s no flash. there&#39;s none of that kind of cumulative shift in nonsense or un styled stuff, which you do get with the shadow dom. Okay. It&#39;s the interesting thing though, is I think actually we skipped over a couple of things.We should,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:38] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: yeah, I was just gonna say, should we go back and finish that list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:29:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, Because we&#39;re saying that our options to us, when we&#39;ll talk about the next option, which changes component based. if you do want component-based design, we&#39;ve got container queries, which came out at the end of last year, supported by all the major browsers, which, combined with some other new stuff does allow us to effectively, control the styling so we, we can set our component up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Style itself according to the space available to it. which means that you can move it as a component in and out of other places. And we also have something which really we don&#39;t understand, but it&#39;s very clever, which is web assembly. Again, this is all standard stuff. This is, part of the web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s, E extra to, H-T-M-L-C-S-S, JavaScript, and then we&#39;ve got kind of web assembly components where we can effectively translate through that. Any other, most other technologies like might be something made. A program that might be made for making a game can be turned into html. So that&#39;s probably something we&#39;ll never get into, but we&#39;ll talk about container queries next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s caught us up on that. But web components yeah, is interesting because we&#39;ll need it. But I think what&#39;s, we&#39;re in the middle of a debate about this. So shadow dom was this wonderful way to be able to create. Components and B standards compliant. So it&#39;s gonna last as long as your browser lasts, which you can&#39;t say the same with something like React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s gonna last as long as React lasts. No. Yeah. but something that standards will be there. While there are browsers, while we have the web, so that&#39;s its benefit. But now you know, the shadow done was a way of being able to encapsulate your CSS, so you can keep it as a separate module, which you can take and put it in your different project without being affected by the cascade of your.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page and the stars there. That was a big plus. But I think what&#39;s throwing everything out now, and it&#39;s not here yet fully, and that is at scope, which is going to be something you can do with your CSS, where you can define which elements you want to start in their particular way. And there will be outside of the cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think we&#39;re on. Because a scope I think is supported by chromium browsers at the moment. So that&#39;s okay. That&#39;s all. Is it? Okay? yeah, It&#39;s 60% of the web, but I think by the end of the year this will be here. So it does throw, the big question up at the moment, if you do need these components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big reason for needing something like Views or React or something like that was if you worked in teams and you needed to encapsulate your style so you can move those elements into your new design and have them, work independently. App Scope really throws the cat among the pigeons there, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says, here&#39;s another way of being able to achieve that, and it&#39;s just within CSS. Do you think that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:32:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: gonna be the beginning of a shift away from a lot of these JavaScript endeavors towards doing it natively in CSS? I genuinely don&#39;t have any intuition on that, but it sounds like it&#39;s gonna enable you to do a lot of the heavy lifting that the JavaScript, it has been deployed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that&#39;s the case, this is much more. I guess modular, understandable. Probably much more readable. Certainly. you don&#39;t have to rely on loading a boatload of JavaScript to get it to work if it&#39;s already, shipped with all the browsers, 60% at the moment. But like you say, by the end of the year, maybe 90 something percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:33:26] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, the pendulum just swing, isn&#39;t it? The, our standards didn&#39;t, HTML and CSS didn&#39;t give what people wanted when they wanted component based design. When that mentality of how we design thing was there, it just didn&#39;t give you what you want, which is why things like React, I think took off and, which I think led to the split of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who maybe just create, regular static sites of some people, they just thought you only need JavaScript. You don&#39;t really need to learn all this other stuff. Stick to tailwind in there, or something like that. And you can sort out the CSS, it&#39;s a bit quirky, but we can do that. And these other people who would be in the old style of H TM L documents start it garden style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think there&#39;s a, move back. The problem has been the technology. So I think there&#39;ll be a shift back. There&#39;ll be perhaps less people who will feel like they, JavaScript is all they need to learn, and more people will say, JavaScript as needed, which is my approach with everything for what I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSS and the HTML is there to achieve almost everything I need. Yeah. With a minimum of, for these components where I&#39;ll need some JavaScript and somebody else&#39;s, someone who&#39;s cleverer than me, put something together that I could insert into my. My stuff, but at scope of course means that I think the light dom will be, effectively at scope, takes care of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, I think. If you need to encapsulate your CSS around certain elements, you can do that within regular CSS or will be able to, I think, before the end of the year. yeah. Nice. We&#39;ll see. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:02] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, moving feast, isn&#39;t it? Or a movable feast. Yeah. The whole thing is definitely moving, but fascinating, what, was true 10 years ago is becoming untrue now, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I guess my, hope with all of this is that it just becomes. Much more straightforward to learn because JavaScript is, for the vast majority of all of that, it&#39;s been beyond me and and I&#39;m hoping that a lot of these technologies will bring. an easier way to implement that, a more understandable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#39;m not getting any younger and learning&#39;s getting harder. So, yeah, that&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:35:41] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: my hope. The declarative language are the easiest. The browser already understands you just tell it what to do. But with the, when you get to JavaScript, it&#39;s I&#39;m going to tell you browser what to do. Yeah. And if you take all those responsibilities and you have to have a mindset, which we don&#39;t have, I don&#39;t think, we&#39;re not, it&#39;s. Some people do, but I, do feel there&#39;s, over this period, I feel like there&#39;s a coming together in a way of this. It felt like everything went, it was JavaScript first CSS within it that&#39;s shifting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there will still be JavaScript developers, but there&#39;s that kind of, because I think. That integration with web components that they can work or you can move things from one place to the other. if you want to work in one way, you can, but for people like us who generally creating those sort of 80% of websites that small businesses need out there, it&#39;s not really a path we need to go down, I don&#39;t think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:37] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: No, indeed. I feel like we&#39;ve covered that particular topic. What do you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:40] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: think? Yeah, I think, yeah, we mumbled our way through it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:45] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Do we want to. Do we wanna talk about what&#39;s coming up next time? I know you&#39;ve written something in the show notes there. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:36:52] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. It&#39;s, just, we mentioned it, we&#39;ll just have a chat a bit further about the same topic really, but just talking a little bit about, container queries, &#39;cause that&#39;s new, bit of CSS and, we&#39;ll try and do our best to explain where we may or may not want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s such a big thing, something that we couldn&#39;t do. And everybody was very excited about it. But honestly, we&#39;ll talk about it next week, but I&#39;m thinking, where will I use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:37:19] &lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. Yeah. okay, that&#39;s for next time. don&#39;t forget, if you want to follow along with what we&#39;re doing, the website is being updated episode by episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no script show is the website. This is episode five. So no script show slash epi, sorry, not slash episode. Anything just slash five. So no script show. Slash five. and we will see you next time. If you watch this on YouTube, please give us a comment that would really help. That&#39;s really nice to, to hear what it is that you&#39;ve got to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And obviously keep an eye on the, that channel as well, because David will be, updating it with his own content in between these episodes. Okay. That&#39;s it for now. Thanks, David. Done. I&#39;ll,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:38:02] &lt;strong&gt;David Waumsley&lt;/strong&gt;: I&#39;ll see you next time. Yeah. Thanks for listening everyone. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Accessibility - Skip nav links &amp; :focus-visible</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/5/" />
    <updated>2024-02-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/5/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;TRANSCRIPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been progressively building the show&#39;s website with a first focus on trying to make the content as usable as we can before seriously tackling the aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have 5 items in the main navigation, it seemed like time to add a way for &lt;strong&gt;keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;screen readers&lt;/strong&gt; users to be able to skip the repetition of these links and get to the main page content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) does not specify &amp;quot;skip nav links&amp;quot;, but says we should have a mechanism to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html&quot;&gt;bypass blocks&lt;/a&gt; of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages. Other examples they give are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News site&#39;s where the users may have to go though many article links to get to the main story and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecommerce sites where there could be many filter options before they can get to the products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sites also provide a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;skip to the footer&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; option too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t need that, but this has made me think about how footers are often used to dump less relevant content and legalese and how we might also want to allow people to skip that. Amazon does this by placing their &amp;quot;back to top&amp;quot; link at the start of their footer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Accidentally there&#39;s no legal links here as there&#39;s no tracking or cookies on this site)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truefully, if it hadn&#39;t been for accessibility legislation increasing awareness (and we&#39;ll probably have more with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202&quot;&gt;European Accessibility Act&lt;/a&gt; coming in 2025) I am not sure how much attention I would have paid to these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a shame I needed the law to encourage me to do the designer&#39;s main job of finding empathy with users, but now I think sharpening up these &amp;quot;soft skills&amp;quot; is becoming more vital. Not just to increase the reach of our website, but to highlight the advantages we have over AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sighted mouse user I almost never use the keyboard on web pages until recently when I had a temporary strain on my mouse hand. Presumably age will force me to do this more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my limited experience of tabbing my way around the web it is frustrating, but this must pale into insignificance compared with those with motor issues who have to navigate pages with &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/articles/motor/assistive&quot;&gt;head wands, mouth sticks or sip-and-puff switches.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many off-the-shelf sites have &amp;quot;skip to content links&amp;quot; added by default they can make things even more confusing when addons (like forms) and DIY user mess up the tabbing order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to add this yourself and do it right, but before I get into that I want to mention (as it&#39;s relevant) the new…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-visible-pseudo-class&quot;&gt;:focus-visible (pseudo class)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible&quot;&gt;:focus-visible&lt;/a&gt; now has support across all major browsers and solves a problem that when a sighted mouse user clicks on a focusable element (like a button) they get a &#39;focus ring&#39; that may only be needed to guide those using the tab key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in a page builder community this issue came up regularly with people saying how do I get rid of the ugly outline around the header text of my FAQ section when clicked. The reason was the accordion module marked up the titles with the button tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; solution was to the add this CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; none&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/&quot;&gt;My solution&lt;/a&gt; was to add JavaScript to detect a mouse action and then remove the outline. Now browsers will by magic (or heuristics) do this for us via its own user agent CSS. No need for JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming we are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/?search=focus-visible&quot;&gt;supporting IE&lt;/a&gt;, we only have to remember to avoid using :focus (rather than :focus-visible) when we want to custom style our focus state as this will undo what browsers are now doing for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:focus-visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2px solid &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--accent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;outline-offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .35rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .1rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;skip-nav-links&quot;&gt;Skip nav links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;adding-the-html&quot;&gt;Adding the HTML&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would have set this up first, but the idea was to build up this starting with the bare minimum which was a single page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to see how far we could go using VS Code search and replace before having to bring in a CMS or static site generator the manage the growing number of pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly add the skip links to all pages I went to VS Code&#39;s &amp;quot;Edit tab&amp;quot; and selected &amp;quot;replace in files&amp;quot;. I searched for the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tag which gave me all the HTML pages and replace with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#skip-to-main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;skip-link&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Skip to content&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link has an ID (skip-to-main) for the same page linking and a class (skip-link) or the styling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeated this search and replace to add where I wanted the skip link to go to in the document. I chose the maing tag Some use a H1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;narrow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;skip-to-main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; I had to do this twice as there were two types of classes already added to the main tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;adding-the-css&quot;&gt;Adding the CSS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed some styles for the link and a way to hide it until it is focussed on. As I have already added a custom focus ring we have that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.skip-link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; absolute&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .3rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-inline-start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .5rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--shade&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-decoration-thickness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.06rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 1px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0.2rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 10&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* styles the skip to content link */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frustrating part of this is that CSS has multiple ways to hide content, but no specific display property for hiding content from all except screen reader or keyboard user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&#39;t use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; none &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as this removes elements altogether. Because of this we have all sorts of over complex “belt and braces” approaches which have to get changed according to the changing inconsistency of screen readers and browser vendors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I have included what is used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers&quot;&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; and Bootstrap at the time of recording plus clip-path (that is supposed to replace the now deprecated clip property, but is used for old browsers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.skip-link:not(:focus)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;clip-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;inset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;50%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; absolute&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; -1px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hidden&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nowrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* hides the link when not focussed */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the live site (for now) I have only added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.skip-link:not(:focus)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
 &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;clip-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;inset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;50%&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to see under what circumstance this today is not enough. Let me know if you see an issue. There was one with Safari, but I think it is fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is clip all edges of the element to 50% effectively hiding everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/accessibility/accessibility_skip_links.php&quot;&gt;W3schools.com&lt;/a&gt; take a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creating links that are not too hyper!</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/4/" />
    <updated>2024-02-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/4/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hyperlinks make the web what it is, I thought I should talk a bit about how we have marked-up and styled our anchor tags on this initial version of the show&#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the podcast is that we are relearning the fundamentals of web design. What this has been showing us is that this process is only partly about learning new approaches and specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of it is about unlearning things that once seemed like cool design, but increasingly look more like ignorance and even contempt for web users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-start-with-the-basic-html-markup&quot;&gt;Let&#39;s start with the basic HTML markup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an anchor link with the VSCode editor is really easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We type &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; and enter on the first option that automatically appears. The cursor moves to where we want to add our url.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If that url is for a local HTML file we only need to enter a forward slash to select from the available files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we only need to tab to where we can enter the text to be linked (just before the closing anchor tag)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; linked text here&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For accessibility we should avoid vague link copy like &amp;quot;Click Here&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; which can be confusing when a screen reader reads them out of context. Of course, we can get around this by adding an aria-label for screen readers to announce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;aria-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;read more about avoiding aria-labels&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; read more...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easier way might be to try (where possible) to design with non-sighted people in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saves having to read the difference between aria-label and aria-labelledby and still doubting you got it right? That could just be me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I programmed the &amp;quot;read more&amp;quot; links on a WordPress blog archive page to add an aria-label that included the blog post&#39;s title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a very common pattern, but often it seems pointless as the title is typically a link that has been styled to not look like a link and so require another for the sighted people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-target-blank&quot;&gt;Using target &amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the VS Code editor we can select the 2nd anchor tag option (blank) and will get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;_blank&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;noopener noreferrer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; read more...&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, opens the link in a new browser tab and VS Code kindly adds rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does this as target “_blank” opens up a security issue which these solve. There is no SEO implication with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also notice that rel=&amp;quot;nofollow” is not an option nor does it auto-complete in VSCode. I am quite thankful for this because I was an over user of nofollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years back I bought into the idea that you could balance your inbound and outbound like ratio for better SEO results. I&#39;m sure ratios matter, but if everyone can prevent search engines from following everyone else there is little point in having search or SEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on I&#39;m using it to prevent passing link authority to sites that don&#39;t reflect the values of the site. My guess would be that with Google&#39;s new focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/12/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t&quot;&gt;Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness&lt;/a&gt; linking to reputable sources might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-should-we-use-target-blank&quot;&gt;When should we use target &amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most previous sites I&#39;ve defaulted to using target&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; for external links. This is something which a &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/&quot;&gt;2014 CSS tricks article&lt;/a&gt; argues is a bad approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this article when it was published and changed my approach, but like one of the article&#39;s commenters says I had it flagged by a client as a bug! Since this article I imagine even more people&#39;s use of social media where external links open a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly when I switched to following people who blog on web standards who mostly don&#39;t use target&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;, I was thrown at first. That told me I had also developed this expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the CSS tricks article is right. When you force target”_blank” you take away the user&#39;s ability to opt-in to that. This, of course, is assuming they know they can right click and choose to open links in a new tab or window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site has one of the &amp;quot;good reasons&amp;quot; CSS tricks list for using target&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; This is that we have audio and video content which could be disrupted if the user clicks a link that does not open a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that is not on every page. Initially to keep the site&#39;s behaviour consistent I made the external links on resources and subscribed page target&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;, but I have changed this to give (our type of) users the option. I would be interested in your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most modern screen readers will declare what will happen, the concern is with sighted users. To help I have added a “link-out” icon with this CSS that selects every link with the target=&amp;quot;_blank attribute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;a [target=&quot;_blank&quot;]:after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;/images/link-out.svg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-inline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0.2rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;--brand&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/hypertext_links#new_window&quot;&gt;Webaim.org&lt;/a&gt; suggests this, but also note that it does not necessarily tell users that a new tab will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t possibly do this video without citing Heydon Pickering&#39;s powerful slide from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/377175838&quot;&gt;talk at Paris Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;underline-your-f-cking-links-you-sociopaths&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Underline your f*cking links, you sociopaths&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to have become a popular t-shirt slogan now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Custom CSS browser agent styles give us underlines on our links by default. It is a signifier that identifies this UI from other things as a way of navigating the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately designers come along and remove them without a full understanding of the impact. Particularly on the 300 million colour blind people of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m particularly guilty of this because I used a builder based Bootstrap 4 framework and unthinkingly went along with the default. They remove the links until the user hovers over them. This was changed with Bootstrap 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Heydon&#39;s talk he mentions how accessibility expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://adrianroselli.com/&quot;&gt;Adrian Roselli&lt;/a&gt; was urging Mastodon to add underlined links. There was resistance as The CEO and lead developer did not want the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/9898#issuecomment-456410756&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;visual clutter&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (and being open source there were other subjective opinions). It seems they have added underlines now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;styling-underlines-with-css&quot;&gt;Styling underlines with CSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course aesthetics are also important and fortunately CSS keeps giving us more control over our underlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can independently colour, style and set the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness&quot;&gt;thickness&lt;/a&gt; of them. We can set them to skip ink ( i.e. leave space for font descenders)or not . My favourite is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset&quot;&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our site, I have used this reset taken this from a brilliant article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://moderncss.dev/modern-css-for-dynamic-component-based-architecture/#css-reset-additions&quot;&gt;Stephanie Eckles:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Baseline for default links */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;a:not([class])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-decoration-thickness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0.06rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 1px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0.4rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference on this site is that I set mine to rems (set by the root) where she uses ems relative to the element. We are using a lot of h2&#39;s as links and ems seemed too thick in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing I like to do to is give links a subtle press down feel on click:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;a: active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; relative&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;inset-block-start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 0.05rem&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* inset-block-start is the
 modern way to write &quot;top&quot;  */&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <title>Web safe or system fonts are cool again</title>
    <link href="https://noscript.show/learn/3/" />
    <updated>2024-02-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://noscript.show/learn/3/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;TRANSCRIPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last video I showed how we got fluid typography for the show&#39;s website through Utopia.fyi&#39;s wonderful (copy and paste) tool. It gives us these variables we can assign to our type elements. Carrying on with the theme of typography I want to talk about fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is an agile project where the aim is to get something out and iterate as we go (in this case in line with the shows content) we are starting with system fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System fonts are having a bit of a comeback at the moment so It seemed like a good time to talk about why that is and why it might matter more in the near future and also mention another great online tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-online-tool-for-web-safe-fonts&quot;&gt;Free online tool for web safe fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, VS code offers a drop-down menu of web safe font stacks when you type font family. That&#39;s good, but if you want more information and choice it is worth checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://modernfontstacks.com/&quot;&gt;Modern Font Stack site.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hover over any collection you will see an information icon which when clicked will take you to GitHub. Here you will see a visual representation of the sytem fonts and will be able to see the font weights avialable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pros-and-cons-of-web-safe-fonts&quot;&gt;The Pros and Cons of web safe fonts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start with the more obvious pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s very quick and easy to set up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No messing with converting and optimising fonts. No individually adding weights. No messing with font-display to avoid “Flashes of Unstyled or invisible Text” no updating fonts because it&#39;s not displaying correctly on X device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s more environmentally friendly and cheaper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you and your visitor are paying for their bandwidth use. Certainly it will help us keep out Netlify host free for longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster page loads which might boost SEO,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Less visitor bounces and a plus point for Google&#39;s algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No 3rd party gathering your visitor&#39;s data and legal risk of fines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Something we have been seeing with those using the Google Font API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less obvious upsides for using system fonts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access pro fonts optimised and updated to the users device.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We would not be able to license fonts like San Francisco and Segoe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiar to users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead to when &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data&quot;&gt;prefers reduced data&lt;/a&gt; is supported&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we saw with the rapid use of Dark and Light preference we could be expected to provide a good system alternative on our websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cons are obvious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Branding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring (but is that partly a lack of imagination?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the time and depending on the type of site we will need a non-system font, but certainly many web agencies are now sugesting (at least for the body copy) the client look to websafe fonts first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently saw this thought provoking quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli&quot;&gt;Massimo Vignelli&lt;/a&gt; from when the NYC SCHOOL OF VISUAL ARTS made him the recipient of its 1991 Masters Series Award:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the new computer age, the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fonts he talked about are not websafe, but this was in 1991 before most new fonts for device were created.&lt;/p&gt;
